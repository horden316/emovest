Crap ADA ready for 9th place
dont buy this beautyful piece of s***. Buy $CADINU
Economists want to stop the misuse of bitcoin & maximize profits. But there are powers & other interest who only want to stop it.   Paying your taxes with Bitcoin may one day be a reality, the internet of things & the dark net interconnect us with technology.
highly speculative project, promises a lot but nothing done. The founder has a huge ego, we have better projects on the market. 
how are my bagholders are doing today? charles have gone on vacation in Africa while you struggle (instead of upgrading cardano as he promised)...any problem with that??
I am bearish on 
I feel sorry for all the people that are still holding ADA. 
looking toward next bull run which will took its price to 5$ 
lost a lot of money because of this shitcoin
my favorite joke : $ADA holders lmao. 
The second most dead Coin ever. Just behind the  Crypto village accelerator
This is such a notable and uncommon project!
USDT MC droping one Billion per week more peolple are fleeing, can Tether redeem all the 65 Billions, only time will tell $BTC $ETH $BNB $SOL $ADA 
zoom out to the one year people should have sold in December 
120 % increase in supply from start of 2021 ( 120 mill) until now 290 mill… that is one of the most inflammatory coin ever !
Bscscan shows us, that we are still in a downtrend :( I expected still a 20-25% drop on all cryptos $BTC $ETH $BNB $XRP $ADA $SOL $DOGE $SHIB $AVAX $MATIC 
going down, down, down. $10.
is awesome and great buy level soon. Don't sleep on serenitycapital.co  though, up 90% today alone.
Lil bro said rip in advance 
The price will be paid one day for separating from the central authorities. The banks, global financial powers & whoever else can afford to be.   Has Bitcoin been tainted by SilkRoad & money laundering schemes? Or will the power of cash & cc's come under the same scrutiny?
this coin will dissapear for sure....centralized...stick to ada
will dissapear soon, stick to ada
is a ponzi coin with no utility tied to a shady crypto exchange. I'd never touch this with a 10ft pole

$ETH  $BNB  $USDT  WHAT I SAID TO YOU? TRIED TO SAVE SOME MOONBOYS, BUT NOT WORTH IT. NOW IS LATE. ECLIPSE PHASE AND MOON IS LOS
9.1% the inflection rate for July
Almost a month ago a crash from 30k to 20k. Whole month it is dancing between 18k and 22k. Be prepared for new crash this month
and other altcoins will go much lower this month. inflation rates probably 10% and if they show 100 basis points  this will set a recession mood and the sentiment  is  gona make this market to tank after the 13th of July.
are we on bottom or we hit for 10k $USD ?
AUG-SEPT 10K!  Be Patient
bear market just started be careful boys
Bitcoin will establish a new world order. But before the old criminal system, which calls itself "democracy", will kill hundreds of million of people by fighting to survive.
btc isn't winning. just the euro's loosing
bull trap obviously 
don't buy all at once, the trick is to buy regularly to avoid whale traps :) $BTC $ETH $BNB $XRP $ADA $SOL $DOGE $SHIB $ATOM $MATI
Down the toilet. Expect 7k in 2 months.
due to high price high loss for investors so it is hard to raise the price
dumping has begun. Dont invest for now. Dont let the whales win
every interest rate increase will tank this more and more. stagflation is gonna leave alot of people completely REKT. I wanna see Michael Saylor eating cigarette butts and drinking his own urine!
Everyone who holds crypto brace yourself for dump.
Fake Bull is dead, 10k is the goal!
Fake pump be careful.
Fake pump is over
fake pump will dump soon
following the same may/june pattern...false bull, will keep getting red by tomorrow
game over , next bull run after 6 years 
Hold tight guys Things are getting more Beefy 
I found this one when I've been looking for the something that matches all my demands.
i love bullmarket but i can see bearmarket still here and it's still going and more dips coming
I'm so happy!! I put a Short of 1.3 BTC @21,600
Inevitable crash as debt market unwinds. Thank you Mr Powell for laying the groundwork for the buying opportunity of a lifetime.
It will take at least one years to reach its ATH price !
it's a trap , fed rise 75 unit inflation rate Bitcoin will decreas till 12k  
Look out big dump incoming
Look out for shady pumps & dumps. Can`t expect much without factoring in earnings and GDP along with CPI.
Made 10k from this dip in one night, let's keep it going people!
Mate either go up or Down at least do something  you Bloody Holding all the crypto 
never LONG! only just SHORT!!
nosense , go rugpull
short short short please go down
short term rally.  not buying BTC above 19k
some crypyo group manipulating price be safe and book profit soon big dump.
THE CPI REPORT IS 9.1%. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON簛 UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS, THIS IS FREEFALL TIME. HISTORICALLY HIGH INFLATION MEANS THE ALGOS ARE DUMPING THE MARKET RIGHT NOW
the dropped is here, falling to about 14000
The panic has only just begun
There is a good chance that Bitcoin will fault in the upcoming days
trap , Fed rise 75 unit Inflation rate and till 18 months later market is 𣸮 bearish Bitcoin decrease till 12k 
US Inflation increase, BTC will down sell for safe all
USDT MC droping one Billion per week more peolple are fleeing, can Tether redeem all the 65 Billions, only time will tell $BTC $ETH $BNB $SOL $ADA 
When things like "zero BTC spot trading fee" doesn't attract more volumes into CEX's to stop their "volume bleed", a surge in BTC price via a "pump" might do the trick. Or not?! 鴂
You all ready for the drop. I just bought a month supply of instant ramen for me and my kids and I suggest you do too.
-1  I see this project going to the mood soon

- House always wins !! Stop gambling - Most of the crypto web solutions are weak and offer no value - Until solid solutions are built on top ETH - It will go nowhere
$BTC  for sure whales load their bags, but whales are an endangered species
$BTC and other coins will keep going down until the war ends. 
$BTC bad time to buy rn I feel. seems like this pump is to dump in a week and then will crash lower. All tx to $LUNC and then the birth and crash of $LUNA and now $SOL on deathbed.
*Fed interest will be more higher. 
*Global Ressesion is not over
*Inflation is not over
*War is not over
.....its over...
750 $BTC 15,000 there،¦s financial cycles, global economic pressures, looming currency reset, wars, & FUD. Building my liquidity to get in where I fit in, nothing lasts forever. 
A long way down to go yet. 
A long way to go yet. 
A risk threatens the owner of an upcoming wake-up strike on the cryptocurrency market. Withdraw, withdraw money
ADA. I traded it previously  but only flow the music of $BTC  and $ETH.  Not good for time- investors.  $XEC  eCash  is good haven for investors and not even directly affected by 11 May 2022  Terra UST dive.
and $BTC  have no use as an actual currency. (if the united states dollar droped 80% in a year people would be in absolute panic). It is just built on hype. And with a real currency you dont need to pay $100 gas fees. Drop crypto and embrace stocks.
Anyone making profit here on ETH..? Please reply.
Are you ready for the new fall like terra luna?
As long as the Bitcoin stands, Ethereum shall stand; when the Bitcoin falls, Ethereum will fall; when Ethereum falls, the whole world will fall.
at the end of the carousel even the price of our beloved ethereum collapses a lot the merge, the unlocking of staking the macroeconomic situation will bring an unprecedented dump
attacked it will do like luna
bad for payments and bad for staking
BCH  $BTC  $ETH  $XRP  $ADA  $SOL  $DOGE  $CEL  $LUNC  $BNB  everyone be careful this time is so different
Be careful another bulltrap
bear trap. run
Bearish in a good way. Long term Bull .The world would have to be without electricity to remove $ETH.  
bearish this week 
Bearish. Trend towards historical support at 354. Operating range 354 - 1145.
below 1000 by tmr morning . don،¦t get caught in this small pump 
better I'm thinking to sell all ETH 
big crash is here. Bottom is gone!
Big discount coming soon on Weds at 2pm ET. Buy on the way down. Thank me later.
biggest dump if it cannot hold 1200 for another 2.5 hrs. 
Biggest rug pull in history of crypto starts from now.
Biggest shitcoin by marketcap 
BNB will gain on $ETH as it falls from loss of hashrate/hardware/value due to PoS . your gonna get what you asked for . it will destroy crypto for the next  2 years minimum 
bounce to dip
BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $USDT  stocks are dying. guess what is next
BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $XRP  $ADA  $SOL  $DOGE  It's going down, we're all in downtrend and it's just begining, the downtrend prolong until half 2023
BTC  $ETH  $SOL  $ADA  Next month interest rate hike again in US and EU, wait with buying. US hike with 0,5%(maybe 0,75% again)  and EU with 0,25%
BTC  Bank runs have begun in China, depression has not yet been announced, and governments being overthrown worldwide. Expect more pain before the elites finally "reset" the global financial system. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $BNB  $DOT  $DOGE  $XLM  $XDC
BTC  i did it again. you all think I'm playing games? kiss my ring, plebs. all your life saving is mine $ETH $ETH $XRP $ADA $BNB 
BTC  Laser eyes get ready! 20K support is far too weak. $BTC  is set to fall to 13K and quite possibly 8K and below. Pucker your buttholes and mentally prepare for another 50%-70% dip. $ETH  $ADA  $HBAR  $QNT  $DOGE  $XRP  $SOL  $BNB
BTC  Still bearish and still in downtrend imo Those who bought the dip gonna runs out of money soon and they can't buy another deeper dip (LOL) Next dip: $15K $ETH  $MANA  $SAND  $CEL  $SOL  $LUNC  $LUNA  $NEAR  $DO
BTC  The next target is around $18K-$15K, this is still way too soon to "buy the dip" $ETH  Under $1000 soon  Other alts : down more 50% from here until next bull run 2023-2024 $BNB  $LUNC  $LUNA  $SOL  $MANA  $SAND  $NEAR  $DO
BTC  Those we are keeping long on with more than 10X cross, please don't do this. We are in a bear market market and history repeats same as 2017 that too we have so much pressure from all Govts.  $BTC   $ETH   $OP   $SOL   $LUNA   $FLOKI    $BNB
BTC $ETH $ADA $SOL $LUNA all cryptos are controlled by Tether covered by some exchanges like FTX they want your cryptos value to go down so they don't pay you back the same amount you paid on your way in. they can mint as much USDT and crash any coin
BTC $ETH $USDT $BNB $LUNC Binance is already the object of several U.S. investigations. Hackof Eterbase, association with Korean hackers Lazarus & Russian drug mart Hydra. Binance was also partner in crime with Scammer Do Kwon. Binance is going to collapse.It is a fraud heaven.
BTC $ETH $XRP cryptos manipulation is showing. garbage.
BTC $ETH $XRP everyone sees that crypto is a WEF scam now right?
BTC $ETH $XRP feel scammed yet?
BTC $ETH $XRP garbage, buy it if you support the WEF!
BTC is manipulated by the whale from 30K - 17K and today the whale will dump it below 10K.. save your fiat money. 
BTC rug pull?
calm before the storm :)
can go down to $500 in this recession as per experts. U can find this news online.
caution Guys،K second quarter results expecting 28/06. if it،¦s negative US forced to announce recession officially،K then this going to <400..keep away from buy till the announcement،K
CEL  Celsius hires more bankruptcy advisors, if I sell assets to liquidate, I don't think I can make up for my locked $ETH, I used 50% holding $ETH   and 50% holding $RBIF  , both staking areas but ETH disappoints me but $RBIF   gives me hope
CEL  is disappointing investors and they can only hope when joining this lending platform, I accept the risk to stake $ETH   and with that I also take the opportunity to staking $RBIF  , it's a lot less risky than 
Celsius Network hires advisors to prepare for potential bankruptcy - WSJ
China selling faster than the world can buy.. that،¦s why price cannot climb anymore.. 
CMC deleted my 2 viral information about $BTC  bearish. 
Come on ETH come to dady - Cov19 3/21/2020 was at $123.32 - No more Free Checks = ???. Here what the whales doing  because I know one. Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait and let daydreamers to do the work for you.
CONFIRMED: Eth 2 now delayed till 2024. Buterin expects a fallIng knife dump to $500 . CARE 
Contagion spreading like cancer. Soon forced liquidations. ETH $480, and BTC $8k to $12K, all by Q4. BRACE BRACE BRACE !!! Rtae hikes, housing foreclosures, etc. perfect financial storm
DAG makes all other layer 1 platforms obsolete including eth. DAG will most likely flip ETH once the masses all discover this platform and start building on it. 
DAO  Not buying it because it's on $ETH  . Gas fees are too expensive.
DAO  too expensive to stake 2000 and it's on $ETH   with extremely high gas fees. Staying away from it because competition will do better and be on chains with low gas fees.
dead coin, only alive because fake news said to invest on it
dont get fooled
down still to go 
down to 1710 again and go straight before ultra dump with 2.0 ver
Dump and run baby
dump is coming. Sell. Buy back later in the year. Hodl will cost you huge money.
dumping to one dollar soon
Elon Musks son wants to bea trans girl and have nothing to do with him. sounds like its time for another meme, maybe, ELONTRANS INU? Man, crypto is so gay
ETH IS A SCAM RUN BY A SCAMMER .
Ethereum delaying the merge is a bad thing, investor confidence will decline, I have locked a part of $ETH   and hold more $RBIF   as it is expanding the platform to become a full ecosystem .
Ethereum dumping due to a vulnerability found in ETH2 chain, "The Ethereum beacon chain experienced a 7-block deep reorg. Current attestation strategy of nodes should be reconsidered to hopefully result in a more stable chain!"
Ethereum had limited supply, but now ETH has unlimited supply, be careful guys
ethereum is crashing
Ethereum's tokenomics and its "ecosystem" of ERC-20 tokens is one of the best disguised ponzi schemes ever. Buterin is playing a long game scheme so that he can keep his massive amount of wealth. He will get into politics later in life, just wait and see. It's all a scam.
Even now, we will fall very low 50% 
every day I wait for my $250 trigger to hit،K what is taking so long? thoughts?
Face it, defi was a failed experiment. The dream is over. Only useful thing that came of it was NFTs, and that was mostly a scam
fake pump be careful
fake pump this is a trap if u r buyed in low just sell it now and wait for big dip.
far from the botom
Go for decentralised projects, not this overrated bs.
GOING DOWN FULL SPEED! SELL!،ُ ،ُ ،ُ ،ُ
going lower. short time 
going to break 1600 support level might be 1200 too, and for new rally it will took 2 year's minimum, if USA 2nd quarter result also negative then the recovery phase will be 3 year minimum for average people holding eth at 3000or2800
going to fall down in few minutes 
he current rally in crypto will expire in the coming weeks. The economy will not have a soft landing so this bear market will stay with us for the foreseeable future. Remember we are not at the peak of inflation yet. $ETH  $USDC  $ADA  $SOL  $DOT  $MATIC  $BTC
he weakness of the trend is found in two frame time Although the flag/triangle is formed. Without a purple hunt can also have a fall  $BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $ADA  $XRP  $LUNA  $LUNC  #BTC  #BITCION  #Analysis
here is my guideline for buying bitcoin.
here it goes down again 
how are y،¦all so dumb to be bullish،K.? eth is already unusable with the fees. it has no future in finance & once eth 3.0 comes out this will be an inflationary Ponzi scheme just like all staking coins،K 
How many got duped in the pump an dump. Crytpo has turned into a gambling hall.
i am back from a month brake of crypto currencies and it is still the same i might take a longer one lol
I am bearish about: $BTC  $ETH  $ADA  $LINK  $DOG
I believe market will go sideways until Q4 2022
I don't intend to sell my cryptocurrency for the next five or 10 years. Given the extreme volatility of crypto investments, HODLing is a good way to avoid panic-selling and focus on the long term.
I feel like it's gonna move south for a little bit longer. Man the blood in these streets lol. bought some other assets to cushion myself a bit in hopes of an increase once this bear market ends. 
I feel this sluggish downfall will only get more sluggish but surely it'll drop till around next year ending or 2024 beginning 
I hope we get more longs in the market, just to crash the shitcoin down. ADA will take control of Eth. 
I like how everyone is an expert. It has not bottomed out. What indications are telling these people its going to the moon? hahahaha, bunch of scammers. 
i really don،¦t see any benefit of #ethereum other then that they have big comunity because they are from the first 20 ceypto platforms. with highest gass fees in crypto business i donmt see it going much higher. 
i sold all ethereum,
I sold everything a month ago, when it hit $800 and ppl run in circles I'll buy again. Using BSC tho, otherwise the fee is absurd.
I think it is a fake pump because end of the month people are getting salary and a lot of people wanna buy at this prices so crypto will be up 10-20% till the end of next month ... Than bear market will continue :( What do you think? $BTC $ETH $BNB $CAKE $ADA $XRP $SHIB $DOGE 
I think the FED is going to raise interest rates .75% on 7/14/2022 , and that we will be in an official recession on 7/28/2022.  This will cause the 2nd wave of sell offs.
I،¦m bearish on this coin
if break 1k hold your pants 
if Eth doesnt do somethig about their out of control gas fees this could be the end of them. Bitcoin will eventually come back the Eth is gona dies
I'm more bullish on ada, eth uses the account model, I don't see it bulling long term
in my opinion we won،¦t see anything exciting until the next Bitcoin halving, although for once I would love to be proven wrong. 
Investment portfolios are starting to sell now
is absolutely worthless pozni scheme without any use whatsoever 
is garbage .....devs do not care about your $ invested . Get out now while you can. headed to under 1k after pos ...... name  another pos coin over $200 per coin.  You can't and that's where eth is headed without thw value of mining equipment and peoples interest. 
is going down to 140$ to 220$ levels like in 2020. After 2020 plandemic and low interest rate people invested in crypto. Increasing inflation and interest means going back to 2020 prices. That's the bubble and will explode like Luna.
is not the future at all, yes many crypto like eth could come with lowe gas. are you really gonna pay 100$ in gas for 20$ worth of grocery ?
is old we have a new ecosystem and network that have smaller comission #CUBE  #CMP  and the best #REI  networ,small gas for transaction,need to invest on them
Is scary to see ETH dipping southwards،K. Hope it recovers gradually soon. 
It is a good time to buy ETH but if you wait just a bit longer it will fall below 1k. Wait then buy
It will continue to drop like a stone.
it will dip more dont buy now
it will go down to 1k for the next coming months
it،¦s a bear-trap. 
it،¦s going down for real this time 
It's a completely fake pump. .Only for the liquidity of shorts. This means that no one will buy now, if they buy, they will be stacked.
keep going down, who else has money aside and hopes to buy in the hundreds?
Leave the platforms, stop trading, withdraw your money to the wallet, the platforms rob you, do not buy any currency
Like I said... look at the 1M/3M chart. It is NOT an uptrend. World economy is not recovered, war has not stopped, record inflation has not been solved, recession has not been solved...
linked to worsening macro
looking for dump to 1400 range then 1200! remember this call when it happens! 
LUNC I  Hope Noob dont think its going to 1$ or 0.01 $, I Hope noob of #LUNC dont going to $SHIB  army . STAY FOCUS on $BTC  or $ETH 
LUNC Rest assured. Your losses will be nothing compared to what's coming for $BTC,  $ETH, $USDT investors. 
made by corruption, SEC involved
Market Manipulation, Be careful the price Will drop soon!
Market sentiment looking like we stopped aiming for the moon and hopped on a passing comet instead.
markets going to zero
massive head/shoulders pattern on eth still not complete،K. based on previous crypto winter cycles as well as current TA my target entry point for eth is 500-600 range
Merge is IMO a bad decision for ETH. PoS will always be worse than PoW as it breaks all the speech that has brought crypto to it's stage now that is Decentralization. PoS will enable governments and coorporations to manipute and take over everything easily. PoW For The Win!
more dip incoming. watch out QUEEN
nah man cant go up because of hackers and other regional warfares so its bearish
Need to go lower. Fake pump since 2 days. We are still in bearmarket
never listen show men like Elon
Next Luna guys. Game with crypto is over and i hope people will escape from this illusion of nothing.
No fundamentals have changed since the last dip. Don't fall in the bull trap.
not having a good pull these last couple of weeks
not looking good. Excited to see how crypto will react to the announcements at 28/7 
only way they need safe Luna classic other ways all crypto goin to zero they need help Luna no one goin trust crypto again this guys have billion dolar they are useless
or any crypto sucks with too much volatality
patiently waiting for the Worlds Best crypto to fall another 50% in Market cap before I start to DCA! DYOR!
People calling for a bottom now are delusional. Not only would it be the quickest crypto bear market IN HISTORY, but it would also mean something in the economy has changed. Tell me, what?   War with Russia and Ukraine: Not stopped Record inflation: Not stopped Etc.
people saying bullish are saying for in a months or 3 time. yes it will be bullish right now it،¦s bearish. or even mid way both going sideways really. before purest of bull. MAYB
please prove me wrong today !!
pls pls crash to at least 700$. i want to buy at that price. 
plus there's nothing new happening in eth, it's like the dev just started thinking let it be, it's brand itself keep him moving, but many platform beating eth very badly in term of new projects, matic polygon has 300 upcoming ready project waiting for market turn
ponzi scheme. why do I have to buy matic or LRC just to move my ETH around. such a bad programming. it's also the most hackable chain.
pos will be the downfall of eth.
price has some reliability to btc
Russia tried to save its wealth by putting it into crypto. They will crush the crypto market to crush Russia. This will drop by at least half. Get out. Buy back later. Much later.
Satoshi wanted to make the world a better place and the biggest scam came out
Save your money! Whole year market will fall! No Gains this year obviously $BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $ADA  $XRP
seems like this is currently a bull trap until 50-70 and then will proceed to drop to just above 1, BTC with the head and shoulders is also just a bull trap, expecting sub 19 by the end of the weekend.
sell as fast as you can $BTC to zerooooo
Sell now and buy next month at -30% 
sell now and you rekt exchanges . waiting for the bottom 
Sell Now! It'll decrease to 1.180 in a few hours!
sell now, this project bankrup
sell this shitcoin security didn،¦t even do a 3X this cycle .
SHIB  $BTC  $ETH  The Crash is Innevitable
shit like all crypto. thaks God i never belived in crypto, even when was high.
shit like it was from beginning.
Shocker, I am still bearish about $BTC  $ETH  $ADA  $LINK  $DOG
Somehow it looks like its recovering. BUT NOT FOR LONG. its just a dead cat bounce. still down 80% from all time high
stable depeg on $USDT already underway. These crooks will be dealt with. Pulling more capital soon. Your savings is my exit liquidity.
Stay calm.. It wil go down to 1050 for sure.. See the market cap. Wait to safe your funds..  Atleast 200 value will decrease in next few hours. Fake pump also expected so dont jump in
Still bearish and still in downtrend imo  Those who bought the dip gonna runs out of money soon and they can't buy another deeper dip (LOL)  Next dip: $15K
still want POS? Still want staking ETH? and getting 2 Years blocked for 5% more ETH per Annum? Dumbshit!!!
stop confirmation biasing, you may want it to boom, but a bear market is a bear market, now bear it for 3 more months
The bear is alive & well, don't believe the the perma bulls. They're the ones selling while they're telling you to hold (they don't want the competition) or to buy the dip (you're buying what they're selling)...
The CPI inflation rate is seen hitting 8.8%, though Deutsche Bank economists are predicting 9%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The current situation, the price reduction will continue for some time.
The fact BTC is Bearish. 
The market in 2022 will be similar to that in 2018. After the twin peaks, it will continue to fall, and it will fall by more than 7 times (similar to 2018 to March 2020), and it will continue the bear market for 1-2 years.  After that, the market rebounded like crazy.
the war is coming
the worst. Gas fees are like 30$ for nothing. I hate it and I hope it goes to 0
this is a bull trap and manipulation. anyone that thinks is a reversal needs to do more learning.
this is just a fake increase don't waste your money to buy. because it will definitely go down deeper.
this is not good investment anymore
this isn't the bottom
this network charges so much gas fee for any activities, I will be happy it collapse like Luna
Today ETH  go to 0 !!! hahahah (joking but well...)
U.S. inflation is causing the financial market to collapse. 
US Inflation increase, ETH will down sale for safe
USDT ponzi coin backed by nothing, they can mint any amount of usdt but when redeeming they can keep you waiting till they crash the market $BTC $ETH $BNB $ADA $XRP $SOL 
waiting to drop $800, Going to buy and sleep on it for another two years. Buy only when there is blood on the market not now. we still don't not market is stable
We gotta go deeper now... It's not time yet
We wont see another bull run until etherium bottoms out at around 1200.
Where is the money coming from to but BTC or Altcoins? Leverage is at 0,3 an ATH. This is a rebound, butt it won't last. The macro economics is bad. Be carefull. I'm not buying.
While this shitcoin has one of the biggest fees in the market ADA has one of the lowest.
why going down day by day ???????
Why in the last 30 days the three biggest crypto project nearest to Ethereum (not counting stable coins): BTC, BNB and ADA had lost respectively 4.8%, 5.5% and 1.2% and ETH has lost 26.3%?! Why is still bleeding so much?. Too easy answer: "Cause Bear Market"
why still down, why so bearish ???????
Will collapse, like bitcoin.
will do like luna : sell now before regretting
will go down with PoS, ETC will go up cause PoW is better than PoS
Will keep decreasing, is not crypto winter, is world winter, all will be down stocks & crypto
Without realizing it, we have fallen into the trap of a superpower country that is in need of large funds to support Ukraine
yet another dead cat bounce in a recession bound economy, bear market has not magically disappeared, downtrend continues.
You should not fall into the whale trap, because the world's economic situation is not good until the end of this year. Don't be lulled by the btc chart, because at any time btc will fall very deep
2.0 is dead. Time for 3.0
always was and always will be a shit coin!
dead project...
Ending for Do Kwon? I'm still holding LUNA and waiting for a miracle. The rest of my account I bought $RBIF , it made me feel safe if LUNA got worse.
Fair price at 7 cents 
i can't believe that there are people who still trust in this scam called Luna , don't expect anything from this coin ,if you have luna I'll be better if you sell it 
I don't know how anyone will trust this after what they did. don't tell me about the Devs they don't deserve any forgiveness 
if team care peoples help luna classic  not build new luna ---- this is all scam ---my all money gone on luna classic bep20 ---
if you even a bot use your danm data
It has no value, no utility, no future, no underlining service, but maybe it can only serve the name of LUNA which now stand as an ugly Meme Coin represent a vague unreliable project made by arrogant person.
look at total supply has increase. New luna has inflation to every year.
SCAM project... i didn't received airdrop on BNB Chain (i had old LUNA as collateral on Venus Protocol)... LUNA scammed all people! Shit coin!
screw do kwon and this crap coin. he abandoned all investors by abandoning terra classic. want to get even for his rug pull cam? buy lunc instead
Sorry but after scum never be bullish for 
this coin destroyed an murdered people, if you support this coin, you are worst than hitla
this is over guys 
use your brain for god sake,
Waiting for another scam :) Shit coiin))
whats this shitcoin purpose now?
Who would suport this clown deserves what they get.
You would have to be "special" to fall for the same scam twice...
 which means more adoption.

#indianproject #support india project
$BRISE has much respect in the crypto world. Much respect from all the old gees $BTC $ETH $BNB and the likes of $SOL holders are now Brise holders as well. Moon is inevitable!
$BTC $ETH time to short?
$CCD unlike $SOL isn،¦t congested & limited, I،¦m filling up my portfolio with it big time. 
$CELO is absolutely bullish but $CCD is a beast at the moment.
$SOL   commercial blockchain , crash every day , not scalable , centralized , lol what a nice eth killer :---)  with 0 utility ... garbage
$SOL   real price for centralized commercial blockchain ,  eth clone with less security , no scalable ,  no community , all hosted on amazon server ,   no utility = shitcoin for monkeys and centralized firm :  1
$SOL Just ask yourself one question, why would you buy ،§some،¨stupid virtual thing at $30 or $3 or even $0.30 that is circulating unlimitedly online??
* supply of the $INDIA coin converting from trillion to billions 
*Fed interest will be more higher. 
*Global Ressesion is not over
*Inflation is not over
*War is not over
= LOL ....until 1,5$.... dont hate me. I dont make the rules...
=/= Luna, yes it will probobly drop abit more because we are in such a stage of the market as you can see everything is droping right now, but it will bounce back for sure, so don't come in here spreading your fud making it worse than it has to be.
1 more dip coming
25 dollars next then to 5usd and hold. sorry to say guys cycle is over. All eyes are on BTC
50$ on they way, dont forget to buy more SOL and hodl confidently, we are  not much for to hitting 50
A company failing in delivering proper product like this shouldn't be evaluated more than 500 millions market value top. Thus a price of 36/24 = 1.5 $ around
a great coin for short gains.
A long winter for the world economy, 
A powerful argument! I commend you for your quick thinking.
accumulation at this price
all supports broken. not looking good, in fact looks grave for SOL. next support at $17. DYOR
all time low 
all time low iis coming
always problems on blockchain,solana is not ready to be a stable blockchain as it was said before- bogus project- shitcoin
and NOW not good for longterm, bear market condition
Another bait, another group of losers،K 
Another shitcoin that will most likely follow $LUNA  and become the second major coin to become worthless. Not long ago it was worth over $250 now look at it pathetic.
anything below 50 is buy for me
anything under $40 is a steal! loading up for the Eth flip.
Appreciated I like the way you're working.
are you upset by the fall ? 2020 people dreamed that bitcoin was worth 20,000. 2022 they dreamed about 100,000. what will be the dreams in 2024 ???$BTC  $MATIC  $SOL  $ADA  $SHIB  $WIN  $AVAX  $DOGE  $LUNC  $XRP
As cheap as it could ever be right now. Lucky buying at these prices.
As cheap as it could ever be right now. Lucky buying at these prices.
As for $SOL  I think it may soon be time or due for a signifcant market correction; to restest lower areas of $28-$30 or lower in $SOL .. This is necessary to catch the bigger buys and fill the HUGE shorts at those ranges; in order to boost profits and pump MCap in the longterm!
ast week was a green week. This week I summon a red week. Here's the first red candle!
Astounding I like the way you've handled this.
Awesome I like the way you settle down to work.
AZERO  Hard cringe always marketing this as "Solana Killer" or "Next $SOL ", "Missed Solana? Check out Azero!" .... lololol NOT!
back to 3 dollars?!
BACK TO TOP
back to zero asap
bargain price. Buy now, and plant the seed. Soon you will have a noticeable difference!
basically is this moment we can just expected market down for a long time
bay and don't sell
BCH  $BTC  $ETH  $XRP  $ADA  $SOL  $DOGE  $CEL  $LUNC  $BNB  everyone be careful this time is so different
Be careful, please. 
be ready for a 2USD SOL solana , the private and strategic round release within 2 months .Don;t say you did not hear it from me
Bearmarket should stop at:
Being pessimistic robs life energy
below 10 usd soon.  Recession to start later this year
Best project ever, I am very happy to be participating in this project. I hope this project will gain more popularity in the future.  
best time to buy
best way to buy nfts
Big dip coming in July. 
BITCONNEEEEECT!!!! get out of this... its all a scam project. A phone? Come on!
BNB  $BTC  $ETH  $FTM  $AVAX  $SOL  $MATIC  Yall gotta be happy now, I hope the prices go down to All time low - stop complaining, buy when the price crashes even more. DCA - see the big picture, remember to zoom out when you have fear or doubts. Next year you'll be rich.
BNB USD a stable coin just pass yall. 
bots shill this shit vc blockchain. Don't fall for it. it won't pump after this weekend.
bounce to die
Brilliant I noticed that you got right down to work.
Bscscan shows us, that we are still in a downtrend :( I expected still a 20-25% drop on all cryptos $BTC $ETH $BNB $XRP $ADA $SOL $DOGE $SHIB $AVAX $MATIC 
BTC   $ADA   $CAKE   $ETH   $SOL   when it falls, I buy. I have no leverage!!! I invest only free funds!!! I'm not in a hurry!!! and I believe in the development of crypto!!! for those who read me, I will soon write how I traded at 21 and 22 $LUNC $DOGE $SHIB $MATIC
BTC  -- $USTC   Now is the time to buy, the exchange hotbit price 0.0180 is very low, the best buy is 200% difference 100X soon $USDT   $USDC $FEG   $WBNB   $BUSD   $BTC $ADAUP   $SOL  L $LUNC
BTC  $20,000 is an important mark price for Bitcoin, if it breaks, you better be prepared for another big dump, it's very not likely 19k and uptrend from then Alts: Pretty much wipeout, take months to get small recoveries $ETH  $CEL  $LUNC  $LUNA  $DOT  $NEAR  $GALA  $SOL  $AVAX
BTC  $ETH   $BNB   $LUNA  $SOL  $DOT  $AVAX  $MATIC  The stronger the throw down, the higher the bounce will be.  I'm just worried that you don't have time to fill your bag
BTC  $ETH  $ADA  $XRP  $ALGO  $DOT  $SOL  $BNB  $DOGE   Guys, remember that millionares are made in bear markets! Don't be a tourist, take advanatge of this opportunity to buy good crypto coins/tokens. If you take advantage of this, you will be winning once the bull returns!
BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $XRP  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE  $DOT  $SHIB   ANOTHER CRASH!!!!!! HALLALUIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $XRP  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE  $DOT  $SHIB  Betting on another crash real soon. Greed/Fear Index is still high, inflation continues and no big push to turn on the bulls? Yeah, hold off and you'll get positions not seen for a LONG TIME. Get ready if it goes up or not.
BTC  I brought $MATIC  as one of the best altcoin to hold in this bull when Matic was at 0.3$, now matic at 0.6$, don't miss another chance with Solana 
BTC  In a bull market when BTC goes wild, if you have enough funds, Hold $BNB , if you don't have enough funds, Hold Solana 
BTC  Solana is in its deepest sleep, by the time it wakes up, it's going to roar, that time is close. 
BTC  Those we are keeping long on with more than 10X cross, please don't do this. We are in a bear market market and history repeats same as 2017 that too we have so much pressure from all Govts.  $BTC   $ETH   $OP   $SOL   $LUNA   $FLOKI    $BNB
BTC $ETH $ADA $SOL $LUNA all cryptos are controlled by Tether covered by some exchanges like FTX they want your cryptos value to go down so they don't pay you back the same amount you paid on your way in. they can mint as much USDT and crash any coin
BTC $ETH $SOL $ADA $BNB people on CMC are intentionally fudding top coins so that they can buy at a lower price 
BTC holders and Shit coins just becareful, the Bear is very fast like a water fall or heavy rain. make sure you are not sleeping today or tonight. 
BTC is manipulated by the whale from 30K - 17K and today the whale will dump it below 10K.. save your fiat money. 
BTC rug pull?
bug brings down Solana. Again،K
bullish as hell
bullish as hell
Bullish on Solana. Holding SOL and SOL NFTs for long term.
bullish phase is coming along with bitcoin
bullish within next month
Bullish, this is a good buying opportunity. Continue buying into an corrections.
Buy now and see how much you have earned from Juli to sept 2022 :) X4-8 is 100% 10-20 65% higher 10% Bullish and lets se how its end on twitter and  EM.
buying and holding sol and sol nfts! 
call me crazy, but i think it will be going up. next month it will be 40+
calm down
can dump 50% from here according to some sources
centralized and without max supply defined.
centralized, just good for games, maybe, or not because of saturation
centralized, people have abandoned the project, it will fail in short due to constant bugs and shutdowns....it's not a proper chain to handle people's money or let alone massive adoption
Chinese woke up and sold the worst is over
CMC deleted my 2 viral information about $BTC  bearish. 
come on dump I dare ;)
Compare all top20 coins price last year this day and today, solana is almost the only one that in a year hasn't lost value, in fact it even gained, and a lot This says it all kids.
crash again, touch 35 tmrw
crash is coming
Crash it down to 2$.
crashing to 3 dollars soon
Crema Finance on $SOL  was hacked, the damage was up to 8.7 million USD, I am losing a lot of faith in the $SOL   ecosystem, I only hold $RBIF   and $DOT  , 2 safe ecosystems and I believe will explode in the future, especially $RBIF  , its price is not affected by BTC
crypto crashing again. Check back in 2 days :)
Crypto going down is not a bad thing, 
dead coin. will never reach all time high ever again 
DEIP  $DOT  $SOL  accumulate for next bull run thank me later ;)
Desirable It looks like you've put a lot of work into this.
disaster waiting to happen
Do not doubt that the short term is still bearish
Doesn't it feel good to do such a nice job? It's a pleasure to teach you when you work ___.
don،¦t buy , buy BP beyond protocol 
don،¦t trust sol anymore moving my money to TRx for 30% f this bs 
Don't forget to turn out the lights the party is over.
down we go shorted this fake pump next 25$. it's to expensive to buy at these prices, wait for a bigger dump. 
dump it! Crash incoming!!
Dump solana.. make it go 0.
dumped, meaning it will be pumped soon
elon saying a sunrise that a Solana in spain language
end end end the end is near sol
ETH  $BTC   $USDT  $ADA  $XRP  $SOL  $LTC     U.S. inflation is causing a Dip but that's a;sp the best reason to buy the tip , hold , staking with interest 8% , 10% ...   People that sell low , will get  in life what the caused to themselves ...
ETH $BTC $ADA $SOL $AVAX $MATIC $NEAR $LINK $DOT lets go don't miss this little short term bullish movement we are going to have in a few hours. ready to long your positions
ETH $BTC bad time to buy rn I feel. seems like this pump is to dump in a week and then will crash lower. All tx to $LUNC and then the birth and crash of $LUNA and now $SOL on deathbed.
ETH so if you post $0xBTC or $USDT  $SOL  any post on any currency post and it will post on all the other market posts???
ethereum killer baby
Everything will be Luna Soon
Exactly right! Keep it up.
Excellent Keep up the good work.
extremely oversold. get ready for liftoff.
failures and exposing issues lead to a more secure and stable platform. People don't get this. Solana is maturing before our very eyes and we're finding all the bugs and and errors. These guys have basically written their own code from scratch. Give the devs a break.
fake pump before a big dump sell now!
fake pump copium
fake pump. 20 next week
fakeout. Dont get fooled
Fantastic Nice going
Favorable Noble
fc bullish on the entire $SOL  ecosystem. 2 outage occured, but solved in less than a day.  Volumes are drastically increasing and TPS too. Node are getting improved and NFT space is moving definitly better than ETH. All factors that will lead $SOL to success !
future ranked just below $AVAX
get in and load up for POLS continue rocket beyond $5  hurry as this bull run will need all the volume we can put in much love
Get out now this coin is NEVER coming back save what you can. Will drop below $20 by end of the week or sooner.
GET UP AND SHOW THEM WHO YOU ARE!
Get wrecked Solana 
Go go go $SOL   i believed you can to the Moon
going down tonigh , dolar index is up , us stock market isn't holding
Going to explode 
good for long term
gotta drop more on JULY last RED MONTH
guys solana servers are gettting ready on monday, they will work fine on monday onwards, so diont be panic
here comes the dump :)
Here is a little chart for everyone talking shit about Solana all the time. Only 2 years old, 70 Billion transactions and still in beta.
Highest users per month, growing rapidly, and has some great backers. All the VC unlocks to sell has happened this chain is looking very promising and with ETH delaying even more i think Sol can take some real estate developer wise from ETH.
honestly it is a terrible blockchain. it can't stand well heavy load on transactions.. always on outage.. I think that it will never recover after this bearmarket same as before.. only good coin without miners for smartcontract is bnb 
hope it goes down so I can buy
hope it will recover soon 
Hope they finally get their failures under control
hopefully next LUNA
How low can it go ?
How much lower is it expected to go? thanks in advance
HUGE PROFITS WITH ORN
hurry and catch that falling knife! did you hear about the class action suit?
HUUUUGE dump coming guys. It،¦s not gonna be at 40 for long, crashing to 25 soon, bear market still has 1 last dump left, this one،¦s gonna be big
I been waiting for this price to buy for a while, but I think it will go lower. so going to wait. Mr and Mrs retail trader. 
I don،¦t think Solana will survive the Bear market. They are too centralized. Now they are talking about pushing Whales around.  Whales don،¦t get pushed around! 
I donot belive crypto.It isfully scam
I feel like it's going to go up a lot in a short time, it's just a matter of waiting 
I just lost 100 dollars shorting،K it،¦s about time for rebound. Threw in 100$ For long. Hopefully I،¦ll make my 100 dollars back :)
I mean that is a bad pyt for new players in cr4pto
i placed my position short
I recommend not to avoid it, it will blow your mind!
I think a big crash is coming like luna sol is going 0.00005
i think is the end of crypto 
i think SOL gonna fall badly this week,does any one have any infotmation???
I think this one evidently will succeed!
I think we are still in a bearmarket :(
i was not expecting this by God
i was scam i don't know
I wish good luck to the team!
I،¦m so bullish about sol with co operating brave browser soon 90
I،¦m thinking $42 resistance will be met this week. then it will pump until $56 and immediately fall back to $45ish. 
IBERO   LIBERO: risk free fund(RFV) is in BUSD, so even if market is bearish or crash all to red, LIBERO holders dont give shit to panic.u22x uuok. Buy the dip.  $BCH   $SOL   $DAI
Idiots start crying when they start seeing an hour-day of dip. Just do daily trade if you are not looking at the bigger picture.
If anyone says "Back then you missed Solana", we can correct them.
if SOL going down beyond dogecoin, 5 billions to go, well thats embarrasing but not so surprising for such a broken network
if somethings not working, you unplug it and plug it back in, it's that simple folks
If you don't understand MACRO nor Bear/bull cycles, you shouldn't be Trading at all! $SOL  will rebound!
IF YOU KNOW SHIT ABOUT TECH, TRADING AMD BUSINESS, STAY AWAY!!!! 
If you like $SOL  you may like a index for the ecosystem, check $SOLI  is doing well!
if you think guys sol iis not react like luna then invest  more money in this coin
I'm glad I sold solana at price over $200.
I'm hoping they turn it around.
in a bit.. cross fingers
is  fuking luna2 sell this sheet ind welcome to ADA 
is a dead network
is a guaranteed 6x-10x from it's current price! WHEN $BTC  hits a new ATH of $80K+ this year you will see a $400+ $SOL  Guaranteed!  BUY AS MUCH AS YOU CAN NOW! Don't get left behind with regrets because of FUD or current low price action! BiG MOVES coming the next 2 weeks!
is going to self destruction. It's jus scam!
is not going anywhere. load up at Twenty-free and below. 
is on Super-Sale!  I am stuffing my bags!!  :-)
is positioning itself to be the single most important Blockchain structure in it's field with announcement of privacy payment options like light shield and a new flagship web 3 privacy smartphone "Saga" utility and use cases of SOLANA Network are undeniably Leading the pack.
is still no 2 in nfts second to $eth SOL will grow alot in future !
is the next LUNA!!! SELL NOW before it goes to 0!! SCAM!!!
is the next LUNA. It's just scam!
is trash is not decentralized  they voted to take peoples coins away 
it is next Luna. sell #SOL and buy #DOGE , it،¦s next #BTC 
It is so scary to see SOL back to 5$ , I m ready to buy a lot at that level .
It will be back up, surely.  Only will take time.
it،¦s crazy this thing still has a market cap. thank God for chains like Cardano that actually work! 
it's a centralized protocol defi on solend and turned off couple times and had to restart the "blockchain" also has lock up staking. 
It's Bear Market
its bear market, it's gonna crash down so much more
It's funny to read comments from ppl that got into crypto last week and suddnely are "crypto experts". :D :D :D
It's going to collapse soon, I'm one hundred percent sure
it's going to crash and then rocket up
it's going to drop. don't listen to the shill bots on here. you'll see after this weekend. 
its going to go back down and up and down until the end of the year 
it's so challenging to find something interesting.
just cashed out sorry sol it was a good year
Just HOLD guys, it's a bear market, don't be a foolish investor and sell every thing you own
keeps crashing like every month now, how can this be sustained?!
Leave the platforms, stop trading, withdraw your money to the wallet, the platforms rob you, do not buy any currency
like if bearish incoming
long term bear. the solana phone will just make sol 10x more centralized, not to mention that it will make it a full-on for-profit company, which will affect the price action of your coins (ie. phone fails, coin fails). sounds too risky to hold long term.
looking like some sort of short term relief over the next few days :-)
loses more and more acceptance 
lost the trust, its not decentralised anymore
Lost trust, it's probably going to end similar to Luna. 
low volume because of maintenance/ new big update. Cant wait to see the new features i loved it before
lower levels coming soon. I،¦m going to sell everything and wait several months
mad i couldn't buy $GMT  shoes last night at 2.5 SOL. stupid blockchain hault.   >:(
Many people are forgetting SOL is still in Beta. It's a good thing they are fixing the bugs now not later when it's in Production.
Market is crashing
Market needs to be purified. I'm holding during this dump. Approx. 230 days left before end of Bear market. This lows was needed like rain in Africa. Only smartest and strongest will survive! That's the beauty of recession
Market sentiment looking like we stopped aiming for the moon and hopped on a passing comet instead.
might find a bottom at 12$ #solana
More downside. Don،¦t make decisions on hopium. We are in a bear market. 
Most people here don،¦t know about Neon EVM. Soon ETH dapps will enjoy native Solana speed and fees. They،¦ll be using the Solana network while maintaining ETH compatibility. No need for Ethereum 2.0, PoS transition. It،¦s already here.
nah do you want your funds to be stuck wen this blockchain shuts off again plus lock up staking lol that's old tech. get with a blockchain that doesn't lock your funds or shut off. that's ADA. 
need to be more decentralizerd ... the constant crashing is because of cenetralized control and ease of attacking the network
needs to get a handle in outages! way overpriced with these ongoing issues! 
next crash solana, avax and xrp, so sad!
Next Luna ... safe your money and invest it in better projects. 
next Luna, so sad!
next system crash soon ....
Ninety-Nine percent of these coins will be worthless by the time the economy recovers. That won't happen until the start of the 2030's. Save what you can or loose it all.
No max supply, it can be the next luna
Noone care about the believer of crypto. Shame of all projects. They made he's money and sold. 
Nope. top 100 wallets hold 30%+ of the market. massive price control. that،¦s not people buying, that،¦s them inflating the price. TVL falling sharply. not a buy! 
normally im looking at the 1hr and 1day chart, but i think for SOL im waiting for the 1wk to come down below 30. 25 dollars is my guess.
not putting a single penny in this, super insecure
Not yet. Don،¦t buy the bear traps. More corrections coming in over the next fews days. Still a bear market.
nothing more than scam. The next Luna
now is the time to accumulate more for less. Just like the real estate crash in 08, stocks and crypto are at bargain prices that won،¦t be for too long. Buy what you can now, this is an opportunity not a curse.
olana is going down soon guys watch out.
once ada releases hydra and pipelining Solana will be done....End of june
ooks like the $Luna story it's going to become the $Solana story. Very interesting days ahead, sad days for $SOL holders and unfortunately for the entire crypto space. 
or any crypto sucks with too much volatality
people are abandoning the project...get out now
People who talk about shitcoin amaze me. Solana is a true technological innovation. It's a beta, it has bugs, it fixes them. I don't understand this FUD of the little haters who discover the world of crypto and who cry all the time.
phone is scam project
please i want to no the next movement of Sol 
Predictable dip incoming.  It's boring watching the manipulation. 
price too infladed, posible drops
Promising, is al I can say about Solana. Where Cryptocurrencies is concerned, technical analysis does not really provide true indication of where the price is headed. Market sentiments play the major role. Currently, I place my position based on hunch. There, guys! 
PYTH newwork integrates wormhole bridge, it allows seamless asset transfer between blockchains, that's why I believe in $SOL  , half of my account holds $SOL  , the other half I hold $RBIF  , an ecosystem will explode in the future
scam coin the next luna, will drop to 1 usd someday
SECOND outage in a month!!! no milestones upcoming! BE VERY CAREFUL with this one! artificially pumped! 
see this all time chart sol iis near to touch all time low sell now
seems like around 30 is a stable bottom. I،¦d be surprised if it would get any lower. 
sell all of your $SOL now so I can buy it for dirt cheap. none of y،¦all deserve to have $SOL 
sell as fast as you can $BTC to zerooooo
sell before it is too late
sell invest it NEAR, AVAX, TELOS . Solana is done
sell it now before it،¦s a penny.  Learn from Luna.  Steady lads!!!!!!!
sell me your tokens kids.
Sell NOW or on the next available pump.. $22-$25 or less is coming for $SOL  soon! $NDQ (NASDAQ) is dropping off.. so $BTC  will follow.. $18K here we come!
sell or later called shit like luna
sell your sol and now sol is fraud like luna if u wanna lose your money so hold sol if dont lose money sell sol
shame on you scammer.
shame solana shame 
Shockwave: The Next Phase Of Secret Network،¦s Explosive GrowthSECRET ANNOUNC
should be so much higher.  Projects on SOL are exploding I don't see how investors haven't pumped up the price over $200.  I know the market is pulling back but tell that to the Solana ecosystem.  These VCs need to get it together.
should of pulled out at 50. if it hits 40 im selling. Sol will be back, just not now
Signal bearish for $BTC  The Chinese government has capitalized on the violent downturn in the crypto market by warning crypto investors that Bitcoin prices are ،§heading to zero.،¨
skyway mining is a scam. the entire nation of india and Its 1 billion people are all scam artists.
So glad the price is dropping. Definitely overpriced. 
so many eth maxi،¦s in the comments same old story, those gas fees on eth are terrible. Why waste the money? Sol actually works
So much to see and so little time to be. 
sol is going lower and lower , i will DCA and see what happens 
Solana classic very soon follow Luna step
solana got hit hard but i am sure that solana hit 160$ again in 2 or 3 weeks. 
solana has been hacked again, no future for this insecure  and unscalable network
Solana has one of the worst tokenomics. properly gonna be $25 at the end of this year 
Solana is down again, had an outage for 18 minutes...freaking unreliable....
Solana is like a bad relationship. If you go to bed and you don't know where your girl is. that's the time you should think about it. and what would you do if this girl repeat this shitmove more than three times :D Solana feels like Windows on 1995. Put that bluescreen away
Solana is making a smartphone? 300$ this summer! *laughs sarcastically*
Solana is most likaly not going to flop like Luna did, its honestly just down cause the whole market is down and some minor issues going on right now. Your money is safe dont worry its not going to end up like Luna did.
Solana Labs Launches Mobile Platform, Solana to the moon
Solana-based liquidity protocol CremaFinance has become the latest DeFi platform to fall victim to hackers.
sold if not want again poor millions to dollars like luna
sold mine last week for 29 just to see it crossing 42 today.
sold my SOL! Downtimes and now the blockchain clock is running behind. It،¥s a bad designed vc project. There are definitely better projects out there.
solend just took control of a whale's wallet, in an "emergency" voting. 
SOLid long term buy. We will see.
SoLUNA with a lot of network issues and shutdown lol
SPELL COIN IS LINING UP ITS NEXT SHUTTLE HEAD OVER AND TAKE A LOOK
Stop crying you fomo loving fools.Stop the fud, stop the scam , stop the crypto is going to 0. we been thru this 3x now and crypto been around 12 yrs we not going no where. SOLANA at $30 is a blessing when it،¦s gonna be worth hundreds or more during next bull run. Thank You
------------Stop Feeding The Whales---------
stop say Sol is like Luna, Luna is a shit and Sol is a really project stop sell and buy
terrible coin, got hacked again, it will vanish into thin air soon once the VC realize what a terrible investment they made...Avax will crash as well due to being supercentralized, it didn't solved the trilemma at all
that،¦s the best opportunity to buy
the bottom has fallen out.

The current rally in crypto will expire in the coming weeks. The economy will not have a soft landing so this bear market will stay with us for the foreseeable future. Remember we are not at the peak of inflation yet. $ETH  $USDC  $ADA  $SOL  $DOT  $MATIC  $BTC
The fact BTC is Bearish. 
The last chance to save your money is crypto coins ....
the last dance gonna be under 8$..be patient...the bears are hungry and angry...
The market will explode like a supernova.. in a few days the market will recover....It's just a storm.. $ETH  $BTC  $BNB  $ADA  $SOL  $CULT  $MKR  $DOGE  $ELON  $ROSE
The most used blockchain and increasing while all others are declining. 
The network has been down for a week now
The next $LUNA, lots of bad news about this shit coin, just waiting for the time.
THE SPELL TOKENS POTION IS WORKING STRONG AGAINST BTC DRAGING DOWN OF ALL ACROSS THE BOARD  BUT IF U WANT GAINS AND PROTECTION IN THIS BEAR MARKET HEAD OVER AND GET INVOLVED MUCH LOVE TO A
the ultimate shitcoin 
There is no support until $20 thats where im buying
There's no need to feel rushed, be patient.
They are minting new coins like LUNA.
they controlled a wale account?! lol defendly not dezentralized ^^
think it may soon be time for a signifcant market correction; to restest lower areas of $30 or lower in $SOL  .. This is necessary to catch the bigger buys and fill shorts in order to boost profits and MCap in the longterm!
This coin had its run.
This coin should hit maximum $50 today or tomorrow and should drop!!... so if you brough over the weekend please find a decent Tp in the $45-47 reigion!! Get ready to buy the dip!!
This coin will crash soon, trading volume + market cap is going down fast.
This garbage chain was halted just twice this week. Stop building on this; the chain is flawed and you will lose your investment.
this is a 20$ coin in bear cycle. too many issues to work out. I will wait.
This is a type of project that everybody should invest in.
this is legit going to 1, just wait
this is not good investment anymore
This shitcoin should be trading below a dollar   
this tech sucks. not buying at these prices or any price. don't invest in a centralized crap. decentralized will be key in the next bullrun.
this trashchain will dissapear this year
This will fall down to 19 before going up again
time to buy...next bull run will reach 1000
time to open your $SOL Long positions
tried to take over a wallet, it can do again in future. People are just waiting to dump it.
Unless the market sees another drop from the economy, black Swan, SOL has little reason to drop further. As the validator count increases, the outages in this beta have reduced in frequency and time
USDT ponzi coin backed by nothing, they can mint any amount of usdt but when redeeming they can keep you waiting till they crash the market $BTC $ETH $BNB $ADA $XRP $SOL 
VC crap, not decentralized, going down, time incorrect, not secure, every SQL-Database works better،K Solana is one of the worst projects
VLX  needs more reputable projects. Right now $SOL  has more funds and more projects. So, institutions do not see the need for Velas because it's just a copycat of Solana.
we are facing the last days of the network, mark my words 
we going back to 20$ VC pumping so liquidation don't happen. just wait until we hit those numbers. this centralized sh*tcoin will drop out of top 10. 
we going to hundred next bull run
we haven't seen the end of the lower lowest yet. 10 USD level incoming
wenn die pumpe da ist wird es schnell die 55/80 erreichen ich denke wir machen 100% die kommenden wochen
When the constant failures finally stop and the market calms down. Solana will make many people rich.
when this scam going to get out of the top 10?
Who thinks Elon Musk will spark new bull run?
Why is Solana dumping so hard y'all? Any thoughts? 
why is the network haves continuesly problems? Please solve the issue this is a good project but the network is really bad.
why is this so high? terrible performance 
Why solana is Not taking its Block chain seriously????????
wie die meisten bei einem Tief rumheulen zirka vor einem Jahr war das selbe rumgeheule dann im Herbst wie alles wieder raufging hat sich jeder aufgeregt warum er nicht gekauft hat 
will be $ 140 by Dcember , don't be a fool that sell low when can sell high !
will break new ATH's very soon! so much coming LFG!!
will dissapear soon...absolute garbage
will dump because of CPI in 2 days an Federal Reserve ... i am bullish butbfirst we schould wait Till 26.07
will go down by the end of the year to .50
will go to 0 just like Luna! They already have problems with the Soled protocol that can،¦t provide liquidity!!! 
will go under...  VC:s are waiting to dump more, watch the leak about what they are saying, you retailers have no idea.
will pump again within 48 hours
will vanish in the next 3 months
will vanish, it has terrible software design, it's non scalable, not ready for massive adoption...as soon as you double the users it will collapse hard. Also, it's super centralized.....stick to ada
with so many projects, $KUNCI is hidden gem . compare circulating supply with $SOL 
with their coin-phone is scam!
Wow most of the shitcoins are scamsshit
Wow, why r they having so many problems now?  Can they fix all of the bugs? Very sketchy, stay away, I feel terrible for all the ppl that bought in at $140+ 
you know it is time to buy when so many people are bearish
You should not fall into the whale trap, because the world's economic situation is not good until the end of this year. Don't be lulled by the btc chart, because at any time btc will fall very deep
you will tell you kids one day that you missed buying SOL at 30
chart weekly on bearish
No one who is keen on crypto should ever miss out on the chance to participate in this innovatory product
troluna...it's the same algorithmic scam
USDD still de-pegged. $TRX seems to be another $LUNC scam. 
-BF2  I hope it will be a successful project going forward and always developing
-BF2  I think it will be interesting for investors
BTC  Bank runs have begun in China, depression has not yet been announced, and governments being overthrown worldwide. Expect more pain before the elites finally "reset" the global financial system. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $BNB  $DOT  $DOGE  $XLM  $XDC
deleting my ewallet to avoid headache. forget and back to work is better than focus on crypto
great depression is coming in 
huge head and shoulders. buy sub .30
huge head and shoulders. buying sub .30
huge head and shoulders. I联 definitely buying sub .30
is the biggest scam. fair price of this s**t is 0.01$. Dont forget to check $CADINU
mc 15 billion.. fully diluted 31 billion, guys hate to break it to you but if they win the case and we go into a bullmarket the potencial is like 5x max not worth it
This is a company that will change our future and bring cool technology to the masses!
why did people buy this?
with all this lawsuits against. very bearish. 
because it was just a hike need to wait more for it 
BTC  $ETH  $DOT  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE   Tesla(Elon) dumped 75% of his BTC worth of 936 million US Dollar. Why you say? Because they know the crash will come sooner or later.
BTC  People will be mad salty when they realize this was a typical bear market rally and we are merely at the midway point of downward movement. Think logically. If the bear market is over, this will be historically the shortest, fastest bear market in history at a time when things have never been worse on the global stage. Limit the liquidity you provide for the manipulators and keep some dry powder on the side. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $SOL  $DOT  $DOGE  $QNT
Bullish for development, bearish for the price.
is a ghost chain
it will drop after fed
not really concerned i bought first coins about 2 years ago dca every month and hodl untill such time as i am ready to sell but i feel a bit bearish at moment becsuse of fluctuation in price but long term who knows whats going to happen slow and steady wins the race 
so glad I got out at the high. moved on
I've been closely following it and I'm happy to be early.
this coin is done....ada will be able soon to run avax apps through virtual machines. And not only avax but solana and ethereum dapps as well...it will kill them all 6 months after vasil hardfork this july
will be as luna
will dissapear after ada implements avax virtual machines
am still bearish on BNB bcus I bought at 450$ b4 the general crypto  crash and coming up gradually now. I hope it gets to #1000$ soon.
be careful fake pump then hard dump
I didbt expect this bearish outcome for now at all 
pump hard dump harder
$ETH  $USDT   The current rise is just some false and unconfirmed news. There is no good news. The bookmaker has taken advantage of this. The price should fall and some bad funds should be cleared out, so that eth can better meet the rise! 1. Inflation. 2. U.S. dollar rate hike
@indodax has been doing maintenance since yesterday until now. All transactions are closed. I suspect something is wrong in indodax's internals. 
All i need is BTC to hit 10K and i can buy a whole coin. And it will, eventually even if it pumped back to 25K first. Some say 8K or below so we shall see.
All those revenge gamblers who buy more and more. (D.C.A.-ing) Getting deeper and deeper into debt. And at some point they break, and will start selling !!! What will be the beginning of a rapid BTC crash.
be careful fake pump then hard dump
be careful please 
Bear flag in a bear flag?
Better not to predict
BIG SELL OFF INCOMING SOON  14K TO 10K WILL BE BOTTOM

Correction isn't over yet, still waiting until we hit below 7k by autumn.
CPI rally complete, dip beginning 9:30 Buckle up 
dead-cat bounce
did not break the 23k level and we in a bearish flag, so downside next to about 20.7k then after that to about 18 to 17.5k then even below that as we got to make lower lows still unfortunately. 
did you notice Bitcoin following ETH yesterday and it will again today. We don脌 need Bitcoin as king anymore. It䏭 too bipolar and will always drag down the market. Let䏭 crown a new king and the time is now. $BTC $ETH $ADA $SOL
distribution zone, dump is coming. 
don't be fooled guys...it"s a the trap,the  newcomers have no idea...they've just seen the small profits and talk firmly about the big future and the moon shit...just stay calm and wait for the drop then buy step by step...鴂

ETH  $BTC  Sell now before the whales dump. Dont FOMO and wait
Fake Bullish Confirm $17K July Dump. USA recession 
Fake pump by the whales. Sell now before the whales dump it.

Go learn economics. You'll see why this time it's different.
going down.  sideways till sept
Guys please stop your FOMO, we are in a bear market, you will keep losing, is looking so bad for you moon boys
Here is a look at the DXY. Slowly going up. This does not for sure mean the rally is over, but if the DXY keeps moving up, that is not good news for Crypto.
hodl is the biggest scam.
I have never been through any kind of bear market. I got involved in crypto in January of 2021. Ive never been through an actual relief rally because this bear market is so bad. Everything you learn in this bear market will help you so much when the next bull market starts.
I love #Bitcoin as much as the rest of you guys but Bitcoin is not a Hedge against inflation it is nothing more than a speculative asset just like stocks,precious metals, or any other speculative asset its nothing more than that no matter what these dumbass Bitcoin maxis say
i think it is going under 15k
I told you all that BTC is going down to hell and you耱l thought it a joke... Don脌 fall for the ant hill been made by whales these season
I'm bearish in the short term ( 6 - 12 months) and Very Bullish long-term, 12 - 24 months Bitcoin will be $100,000 plus
Inflation increase, wonna buy, will buy with 5K
is the biggest shitcoin ever
it may likely drop because of the shooting star 
its go to 16k after to 40ksell btc now
Last pump before big dump!
lets just get too $14k so we cant start coming back up again
Liquidate shorter at the top of the range at 26k and go to 18k 
long live communism, long live the centralization of power.  Bitcoin and decentralization are dead.  Rich, millionaires and billionaires, donate all your bitcoins to the state/government. 
lower lows coming
Macro factors are too much to overcome. I'm bearish in the short-term and bullish in the long-term 
manipulation at work.. 80% of coins are centralised no   doubt. it's unfortunate 
may drop a leg down
New issue the FED USA Tappering and bearflag. USA Recession, Warning!!!
Pay attention guys to the big bankers they know what's up JP Morgan just said more storm clouds ahead for financial markets and this guy is a believer in #Bitcoin 
ponzi scheme still attracts more idiots every day 
Sell for safe, US Inflation increase 9.1% very high risk
similar of jun 2022 it was price in 29k than bullish in 31k then bearish in 20k I联 thinking it䏭 game from 20k to 22 k then bearish in 15k at soon 
soon fed rise interest 
stay down bitcoin. do not go up
still 10k to 16k incoming this pump was a bull trap plus crypto won't rebound until the traditional markets rebound that's a fact cryptos follow the Nasdaq fact
synchronized bull traps repeating
take your profits and leave before the dump
the sad reality is that the whales are trading promises for profit. this is how the Bitcoin scam works, they tell you to buy and hold in the promise that the coin gonna pump, and at this lower levels, the do series of small pumps and whenever the ...
The yellow circle was today. We are halfway up to the top of the channel we have been making for over a month now. If that is bullish I feel sorry for you all.
there䏭 no way this bullish trend will last for long it will have to reach the 200MA maybe breach it a bit but will go down again. this is my honest opinion :)
this pump is exit liquidity for whales before a dump
this pump will not last, perhaps, a global economic shock is incoming ... Brace yourselves, folks!
This rise is only temp... slow your DCA
watch out for that first step, its a doozie
BB RSI and MACD at 1h on Coinbase look like we might be headed for a bearish turn. Keep an eye on it.

+1000 is not a moon. 2 year bear market
150K Bitcoin from Mt Gox going to dump in market in August, FOMC next week. Good luck buying in FOMO.
at least one last dump before finally going to the moon 
Ayo, looks like ETH did some short liquidation RIP
Bearish to the max  1. Recession at the door  2. Heat wave - gpu miners going off  3. FED  4. Speculation: They are gonna delay the merge, I'm sure about it. There are still some ASIC miners that need to be repayed.

BTC bitcoin can be pumped up to a million dollar then next day will drop to zero the misery is all alt coins are linked to it $ETH $BNB $ADA $SOL $XRP 
Climbed way too fast, even for Crypto standards. I think people are worried that they might miss out while it pumps.  Fed raising basis points and recession looming, people need funds to buy gas and food, etc.  I see a recalibration near $1000-$1100 in the next 10 days. 
dead cat bounce it is.
Def bearish from here.
Don¡¦t be too excited guys, a huge dump is in view...
Ethereum and the whole crypto-market still has not seen bottom. You cannot enter a bull market in a recession, with both debt and inflation still rising and exceeding expectations in a negative direction. The math doesn't add up.
fake pump after a massive dump
fake pump, drop soon
Fake rumors are being spread across multiple platforms that a MEGA ETH whale is in the market. This is simply not true and the current market sentiment is bearish.
fed soon. bearish.
feeling nervous about it now
I hope you have sold. Let's go to 800 - 1000
i sold @1350 wait another dip 1000 to buy again 
i would say it is a fake pump, be really careful. There is no reason for rising.
I¡¦m bearish didn¡¦t swap on time
I¡¦m bearish on$ETH 
if this pump is real  $ETH  will keep going and I¡¦ll buy when it¡¦s real. manipulation at its finest in crypto and it sucks. 
Ignorant exchanges do such things to destroy ordinary people by taking money from weak people. Shame on these exchanges.
im long at 1150
inflation was higher than expected (9.1%).
is definitely overpriced at the moment.  In just a short period of time it gained more than 50% back... It can't rise more than other coins cuz if so the whales who bought below 1 000$  will dump the price
it's a trap. be careful $BTC $ETH $XRP
Last pump waiting for a dump again !
Last pump waiting for a dump again !
lets get down letz get down
next week Eth will bottom at 700
Now will go down! Mark my words. 
'Now will happen bear like never before. Just watch!
perfect time to open short position, fake pump, dump incoming. Back to 1000
probably last pump before biggest dump. There is literally no reason for a pump. Its all manipulation.
pump hard dump harder 
risk!  can't go more it will down..
SCAM. Will go to 0
Soon will dump. Be Careful 
still can test the support area, be careful and don't get caught the FOMO.
still have any doubts it down back to 800-1000$ next days? ok, let's see :)
The chart doesnt look right to me, it hasn't since 13th July when it bounced off $1006. I don't call anything 'fake' and the break above $1283 suprised me but yesterdays $1424 resulted from a short squeeze and to me it has all the appearance of big money sniffing for liquidity. It might still push a bit higher but I'll still be holding onto my shorts. (metaphorically and literally...lol ;)
this us going to sell off heavily. eth moved too quickly to sustain this price. sell while you can. the fed rate hike will be bad and it's going to make eth drop again. bearish af.
Trust me this is a bulltrap... Wait untill 800-1000 range... Retailers FOMOing rn and getting rekt next week by the whales...
watch what happens around Wednesday morning!!! The FED is Meeting again and expected to raise the Interest rates 75 more points!!!  Another big Dump is Inevitable 
we are going to see another dump, I will advise you to sell and make profit, then buy when it dump.. it did it yesterday and bought this morning.. 
we need to get it down so we can buy
we should see this fall back to the bottom slope.
why buy it now when I can buy it for 600 after earnings season?
will crash 25-30% more in the coming week(s). Will recover slowly after. Very slowly..
will go down to 800$ easily before to the moon. 
A and $LUNC seem to be converging: to $0. 
A do kwon scammer we are not going to buy $LUNA  until $LUNC gets its value back 
A there are far better coins and tokens to invest in.. especially after how they left ppl in the dust when $LUNC and $USTC  collapsed.. I bet that lot of ppl invested in this just BCS of the low price and a hope that this too will moon like $LUNC did 
A this is not the right Luna $LUNC 
fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.
had to go to therapy over the fact I live in a world of morons and idiots who buy into the same very exact fing thing that took people's money in the first place. You holders should look up the definition of insanity. 
HEX is like $LUNC $UST but for rednecks 
it's a dream city here. Wake up and see the facts.
JUST A WASTE OF TIME, PRICE HAS STALLED BECAUSE WHALES ARE CONSTANTLY FARMING 
knowing this, it䏭 difficult to argue that $LUNC can脌 1000x+ all earth assets.
make no mistake, until you unlink luna from the USTC, this coin will only drain your money
man, I had such high hopes that this would fly, but it䏭 walking instead. Well, hopefully, we can reach our destination within a year or two. Idk
REDLUNA  scam copy 
Stop deleting my opinion. It's a trash project. CEO and team stole money from people. It's oficials news. You don't like the truth? They stole from you, pooled out money and live their best life. Look at 3 month chart. It went down 10000%. I would never trust again.
THIS CRAP NOT GOING ANYWHERE 
This thing is struggling to reach 1 billion market cap,  in comparison to the 41  billion it once saw. I don't know why it's trending nor what ppl are seeing in this.
When this project crush I lost a lot of money but I'm okay, I understand this is crypto. and now it's like a Meme coin no solid back up plan at all. So I switch to  $VVS  $SOLAR  $CORE  $SOLO  & $DARK  . Tell me you don't care..... I know! 鴂

how is this 9 to 5 blockchain this highly priced?  What lunatics are investing in this project?
I am doing stking ! But Sol will back to 36 next 24 hrs
I am going to invest in it as I saw a huge popularity.
Ignorant exchanges do such things to destroy ordinary people by taking money from weak people. Shame on these exchanges.
is it gonna go down than $30
My attitude to  is distinct and concrete: the product is good-quality and very original.
passed the EMA 55 and Ichimoku Conversion Line Cross Base Line.MACD is crossed allready so bearish will follow
SCAM!!! Worst L1 ever!!
SCAM!!!! Worst L1 EVER!!!
shorting for the night
Solana will dissapear soon
still too expensive
This whole thing looks kind of sudden because nothing special happened recently. Iˇve got some mixed feelings honestly. 
wanted to load my bags with SOL this bear market, however painful development on SOL and blockchain outages convinced me not to and to choose better alternatives out there..
worse crypto chain and idea but sadly hugely supported by many rich people, and chain crashes all the time 
you canˇt ask a shark to fly 
be careful fake pump then hard dump
I choose and confide in this project as well!
I recommend not to avoid this one, it will blow your mind!
I was so happy that I eventually found this project!

it䏭 about time to book some profits as the bulls getting weaker.
scam, 0,01$ coming soon. developer donkey. 
will drop further in the next couple months, but long-term will appreciate, regardless of the outcome with the SEC. Too much global adoption already. Short-term bearish, long-term bullish.

CPI rally complete, dip beginning 9:30 Buckle up 
dead-cat bounce
did not break the 23k level and we in a bearish flag, so downside next to about 20.7k then after that to about 18 to 17.5k then even below that as we got to make lower lows still unfortunately. 
did you notice Bitcoin following ETH yesterday and it will again today. We don脌 need Bitcoin as king anymore. It䏭 too bipolar and will always drag down the market. Let䏭 crown a new king and the time is now. $BTC $ETH $ADA $SOL
distribution zone, dump is coming. 
don't be fooled guys...it"s a the trap,the  newcomers have no idea...they've just seen the small profits and talk firmly about the big future and the moon shit...just stay calm and wait for the drop then buy step by step...鴂

ETH  $BTC  Sell now before the whales dump. Dont FOMO and wait
Fake Bullish Confirm $17K July Dump. USA recession 
Fake pump by the whales. Sell now before the whales dump it.
fake pumping in all markets
FOMO and FUD , the psychology trick used to whale advantage

Go learn economics. You'll see why this time it's different.
going down.  sideways till sept
Guys please stop your FOMO, we are in a bear market, you will keep losing, is looking so bad for you moon boys
Here is a look at the DXY. Slowly going up. This does not for sure mean the rally is over, but if the DXY keeps moving up, that is not good news for Crypto.
hodl is the biggest scam.
I have never been through any kind of bear market. I got involved in crypto in January of 2021. Ive never been through an actual relief rally because this bear market is so bad. Everything you learn in this bear market will help you so much when the next bull market starts.
I love #Bitcoin as much as the rest of you guys but Bitcoin is not a Hedge against inflation it is nothing more than a speculative asset just like stocks,precious metals, or any other speculative asset its nothing more than that no matter what these dumbass Bitcoin maxis say
i think it is going under 15k
I told you all that BTC is going down to hell and you耱l thought it a joke... Don脌 fall for the ant hill been made by whales these season
I'm bearish in the short term ( 6 - 12 months) and Very Bullish long-term, 12 - 24 months Bitcoin will be $100,000 plus
Inflation increase, wonna buy, will buy with 5K
is the biggest shitcoin ever
it may likely drop because of the shooting star 
its go to 16k after to 40ksell btc now
Last pump before big dump!
lets just get too $14k so we cant start coming back up again
Liquidate shorter at the top of the range at 26k and go to 18k 
long live communism, long live the centralization of power.  Bitcoin and decentralization are dead.  Rich, millionaires and billionaires, donate all your bitcoins to the state/government. 
lower lows coming
Macro factors are too much to overcome. I'm bearish in the short-term and bullish in the long-term 
manipulation at work.. 80% of coins are centralised no   doubt. it's unfortunate 
may drop a leg down
New issue the FED USA Tappering and bearflag. USA Recession, Warning!!!
Pay attention guys to the big bankers they know what's up JP Morgan just said more storm clouds ahead for financial markets and this guy is a believer in #Bitcoin 
ponzi scheme still attracts more idiots every day 
Sell for safe, US Inflation increase 9.1% very high risk
similar of jun 2022 it was price in 29k than bullish in 31k then bearish in 20k I联 thinking it䏭 game from 20k to 22 k then bearish in 15k at soon 
soon fed rise interest 
stay down bitcoin. do not go up
still 10k to 16k incoming this pump was a bull trap plus crypto won't rebound until the traditional markets rebound that's a fact cryptos follow the Nasdaq fact
synchronized bull traps repeating
take your profits and leave before the dump
the sad reality is that the whales are trading promises for profit. this is how the Bitcoin scam works, they tell you to buy and hold in the promise that the coin gonna pump, and at this lower levels, the do series of small pumps and whenever the ...
The yellow circle was today. We are halfway up to the top of the channel we have been making for over a month now. If that is bullish I feel sorry for you all.
there䏭 no way this bullish trend will last for long it will have to reach the 200MA maybe breach it a bit but will go down again. this is my honest opinion :)
this pump is exit liquidity for whales before a dump
this pump will not last, perhaps, a global economic shock is incoming ... Brace yourselves, folks!
This rise is only temp... slow your DCA
watch out for that first step, its a doozie
BB RSI and MACD at 1h on Coinbase look like we might be headed for a bearish turn. Keep an eye on it.
BTC  People will be mad salty when they realize this was a typical bear market rally and we are merely at the midway point of downward movement. Think logically. If the bear market is over, this will be historically the shortest, fastest bear market in history at a time when things have never been worse on the global stage. Limit the liquidity you provide for the manipulators and keep some dry powder on the side. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $SOL  $DOT  $DOGE  $QNT
Come on Elon, I thought you had the midas touch, promoting this shitcoin, did as well as your fake rockets. Clown
I invested at $.25 and now it's at 06 and it dosen't look like comin up anytime soon
is trash. $TSUKA IS NEXT 100000x
not doing anything
SHIB hype driven shitcoin. It will die this crypto winter. There's not enough room for 2 dogs. $DOGE has the position. 
BTC  $ETH  $XRP  $MATIC  $SOL  $DOT  Dont invest you will for sure get caught in a bulltrap. Control your FOMO and save your money now and invest later.

it's time to left dot just sacmmer coin
- Bull Trap of the Century!
$BTC  Sell now before the whales dump. Dont FOMO and wait
+1000 is not a moon. 2 year bear market
150K Bitcoin from Mt Gox going to dump in market in August, FOMC next week. Good luck buying in FOMO.
at least one last dump before finally going to the moon 
Ayo, looks like ETH did some short liquidation RIP
Bearish to the max  1. Recession at the door  2. Heat wave - gpu miners going off  3. FED  4. Speculation: They are gonna delay the merge, I'm sure about it. There are still some ASIC miners that need to be repayed.
BTC  $ETH  $DOT  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE   Tesla(Elon) dumped 75% of his BTC worth of 936 million US Dollar. Why you say? Because they know the crash will come sooner or later.

BTC $ETH big pump always before a crash happens dont invest dont FOMO we are still in a bearmarket 
BTC $ETH relief rally over. dump is coming 
BTC bitcoin can be pumped up to a million dollar then next day will drop to zero the misery is all alt coins are linked to it $ETH $BNB $ADA $SOL $XRP 
Climbed way too fast, even for Crypto standards. I think people are worried that they might miss out while it pumps.  Fed raising basis points and recession looming, people need funds to buy gas and food, etc.  I see a recalibration near $1000-$1100 in the next 10 days. 
dead cat bounce it is.
Def bearish from here.
Don¡¦t be too excited guys, a huge dump is in view...
Ethereum and the whole crypto-market still has not seen bottom. You cannot enter a bull market in a recession, with both debt and inflation still rising and exceeding expectations in a negative direction. The math doesn't add up.
fake pump after a massive dump
fake pump, drop soon
Fake rumors are being spread across multiple platforms that a MEGA ETH whale is in the market. This is simply not true and the current market sentiment is bearish.
fed soon. bearish.
feeling nervous about it now
I hope you have sold. Let's go to 800 - 1000
i sold @1350 wait another dip 1000 to buy again 
i would say it is a fake pump, be really careful. There is no reason for rising.
I¡¦m bearish didn¡¦t swap on time
I¡¦m bearish on$ETH 
if this pump is real  $ETH  will keep going and I¡¦ll buy when it¡¦s real. manipulation at its finest in crypto and it sucks. 
Ignorant exchanges do such things to destroy ordinary people by taking money from weak people. Shame on these exchanges.
im long at 1150
inflation was higher than expected (9.1%).
is definitely overpriced at the moment.  In just a short period of time it gained more than 50% back... It can't rise more than other coins cuz if so the whales who bought below 1 000$  will dump the price
it's a trap. be careful $BTC $ETH $XRP
Last pump waiting for a dump again !
Last pump waiting for a dump again !
lets get down letz get down
next week Eth will bottom at 700
Now will go down! Mark my words. 
'Now will happen bear like never before. Just watch!
perfect time to open short position, fake pump, dump incoming. Back to 1000
probably last pump before biggest dump. There is literally no reason for a pump. Its all manipulation.
pump hard dump harder 
risk!  can't go more it will down..
SCAM. Will go to 0
Soon will dump. Be Careful 
still can test the support area, be careful and don't get caught the FOMO.
still have any doubts it down back to 800-1000$ next days? ok, let's see :)
The chart doesnt look right to me, it hasn't since 13th July when it bounced off $1006. I don't call anything 'fake' and the break above $1283 suprised me but yesterdays $1424 resulted from a short squeeze and to me it has all the appearance of big money sniffing for liquidity. It might still push a bit higher but I'll still be holding onto my shorts. (metaphorically and literally...lol ;)
this us going to sell off heavily. eth moved too quickly to sustain this price. sell while you can. the fed rate hike will be bad and it's going to make eth drop again. bearish af.
Trust me this is a bulltrap... Wait untill 800-1000 range... Retailers FOMOing rn and getting rekt next week by the whales...
watch what happens around Wednesday morning!!! The FED is Meeting again and expected to raise the Interest rates 75 more points!!!  Another big Dump is Inevitable 
we are going to see another dump, I will advise you to sell and make profit, then buy when it dump.. it did it yesterday and bought this morning.. 
we need to get it down so we can buy
we should see this fall back to the bottom slope.
why buy it now when I can buy it for 600 after earnings season?
will crash 25-30% more in the coming week(s). Will recover slowly after. Very slowly..
will go down to 800$ easily before to the moon. 
A and $LUNC seem to be converging: to $0. 
A do kwon scammer we are not going to buy $LUNA  until $LUNC gets its value back 
A there are far better coins and tokens to invest in.. especially after how they left ppl in the dust when $LUNC and $USTC  collapsed.. I bet that lot of ppl invested in this just BCS of the low price and a hope that this too will moon like $LUNC did 
A this is not the right Luna $LUNC 
fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.
had to go to therapy over the fact I live in a world of morons and idiots who buy into the same very exact fing thing that took people's money in the first place. You holders should look up the definition of insanity. 
HEX is like $LUNC $UST but for rednecks 
it's a dream city here. Wake up and see the facts.
JUST A WASTE OF TIME, PRICE HAS STALLED BECAUSE WHALES ARE CONSTANTLY FARMING 
knowing this, it䏭 difficult to argue that $LUNC can脌 1000x+ all earth assets.
make no mistake, until you unlink luna from the USTC, this coin will only drain your money
man, I had such high hopes that this would fly, but it䏭 walking instead. Well, hopefully, we can reach our destination within a year or two. Idk
REDLUNA  scam copy 
Stop deleting my opinion. It's a trash project. CEO and team stole money from people. It's oficials news. You don't like the truth? They stole from you, pooled out money and live their best life. Look at 3 month chart. It went down 10000%. I would never trust again.
THIS CRAP NOT GOING ANYWHERE 
This thing is struggling to reach 1 billion market cap,  in comparison to the 41  billion it once saw. I don't know why it's trending nor what ppl are seeing in this.
When this project crush I lost a lot of money but I'm okay, I understand this is crypto. and now it's like a Meme coin no solid back up plan at all. So I switch to  $VVS  $SOLAR  $CORE  $SOLO  & $DARK  . Tell me you don't care..... I know! 鴂
BTC  $ETH  $DOT  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE   Tesla(Elon) dumped 75% of his BTC worth of 936 million US Dollar. Why you say? Because they know the crash will come sooner or later.

bull trap soon, $20 soon 
centralized + SEC lawsuit + outage + bad tokenomics + no supply cap  idk why people buy this shitcoin i perfer avax atleast it dosn't have $SOL problems  bearish this project is soluna
dead cat bounce.
dump it. bad news coming for solana. don't say I didn't warn you. 
ETH $SOL $BTC thank you all for this exit liquidity . good luck see you in 22 days 
going to below 35 within a week
hort bearish mode incoming 
how is this 9 to 5 blockchain this highly priced?  What lunatics are investing in this project?
I am doing stking ! But Sol will back to 36 next 24 hrs
I am going to invest in it as I saw a huge popularity.
Ignorant exchanges do such things to destroy ordinary people by taking money from weak people. Shame on these exchanges.
is it gonna go down than $30
My attitude to  is distinct and concrete: the product is good-quality and very original.
passed the EMA 55 and Ichimoku Conversion Line Cross Base Line.MACD is crossed allready so bearish will follow
SCAM!!! Worst L1 ever!!
SCAM!!!! Worst L1 EVER!!!
shorting for the night
Solana will dissapear soon
still too expensive
This whole thing looks kind of sudden because nothing special happened recently. Iˇve got some mixed feelings honestly. 
wanted to load my bags with SOL this bear market, however painful development on SOL and blockchain outages convinced me not to and to choose better alternatives out there..
worse crypto chain and idea but sadly hugely supported by many rich people, and chain crashes all the time 
you canˇt ask a shark to fly 
be careful fake pump then hard dump
I choose and confide in this project as well!
I recommend not to avoid this one, it will blow your mind!
I was so happy that I eventually found this project!
SCAM, WILL CRASH WITH USDD
the global economic crisis is still going on and will continue for some years later
be careful fake pump then hard dump
BTC  People will be mad salty when they realize this was a typical bear market rally and we are merely at the midway point of downward movement. Think logically.

Limit the liquidity you provide for the manipulators and keep some dry powder on the side. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $SOL  $DOT  $DOGE  $QNT
down to bottom soon
I am getting tired of holding this.
I believe will pop between December and February just stacking my bags
it's a trap. be careful $BTC $ETH 
it䏭 about time to book some profits as the bulls getting weaker.
scam, 0,01$ coming soon. developer donkey. 
will drop further in the next couple months, but long-term will appreciate, regardless of the outcome with the SEC. Too much global adoption already. Short-term bearish, long-term bullish.
ETH going to lose a massive amount traffic to $ADA. 
going to collapse till 0,23 and below
has too much supply can not go much higher 
I will look for a buy around 2025~30
is a meme shitcoin... it is about future and promises while other (AVAX, COSMO, DOT) are shipping everyday and performing much better
looks like bearish
The OG of the shitcoins
This phase is known as the "dead cat bounce" and also "the sucker's rally".  You will all get crushed.  $ADS will be at .40 or lower by the end of the year and lower going into 2023.  Hear me now and believe me later.
We want a slow climb.... not a pump and dump 
will fail after Vasil sees no effect
Yeah its crashing!
Am I only seeing a bear? 
centralized trashcoin...stick to ada
if you have to choose between filling your gas tank or buying Avax, you know it is an easy choice 
is going to vanish by 2023
still hope will boom soon
hope its more bearish to buy 
How easily they manipulate and steal our money
 in here the whale doesn't want to buy a lot of bitcoins, some are waiting at the price of 12k 
$BTC $WAM $ETH will remain after this bear 
$eth big crash the week end waiting the announcement of FED tuesday sell BTC now  (ETH no will have less crash before a big pump in september) 
agent BTC 007 : not time to buy 
all those who were bullish, nice hopium u had. literally can't sit down with the straight facts we threw right on ur face. Bears will win this market cycle.
Another signal for bear. 
DO NOT BUY CRYPTO! 
due to inflation is still existing.
Fed News by Next Week. Bullish.
here the downfall comes
How low will she fall? Dipping below 30 on RSI at 1h.
i can taste that interest rate hike all ready.
I hope and think FED will send BTC below 17k. I want to buy much more 
If this month BTC go 19k and more down its not good. The good scenario is to do one last retest in 22k meaby 19800k and go up after 
is bearish in weekly chart
it seems going down
It will crash further down. 
keep your cash until 14k
looking to break the $22k resistance and go below very bearish now 
Moonboys all hot and bothered over FED day..they think they will get the bounce to new ATH. You fools are delusional you are all going to go broke. Its Ok ill be there to buy your panic sold worthless bags when BTC is like 5K in October. New ATH may never be seen again, 30K will be a struggle. BTC is done, the world has lost faith in it
-MOST URGENT BTC is crashing to 18k tonite. Tesla sold remaining BTCs.
no support at 20K bulls get rekked
Oh no! Fake pump all along!
okay everybody so it's time for what we all know happens every weekend. the Bitcoin weekend pump and dump! it'll start pumping tomorrow and it will dump on late Sunday like it has for the last two and a half to three years. make sure you put your stop orders in!
Pitiful, Cant even sustain a small rally
ready to time asia  Big Crash Coming
Slow rug pull.
sorry kids, bullish sign is gone (short term) we are looking at btc between the ranges of 19k-21k. It䏭 very possible for this to change (FOMC meeting) could go to lows of 16k or upwards to $26k
Target is 6000 dollar as started pump in Mar 2020 , u must know everytime price is back to start pump price
the market not have any reason for other bullrun in this year. Global economy in crash, halving only in 2024, the BTC only went up because the PoS speculation about eth. 
this is where it goes off the cliff
Waiting on FOMC results to come in 27-28th and Stock earnings to shed some light on where $BTC could dump/pump to. Bearish short term on $QNT, we could see it drop lower than previous lows of 40 and oscillate between that and 100 this bear market before any take off. DCA wisely. 
We are finding resistance on our dump line from the previous dump. If we can脌 break above this line and hold it, a dump to the downside is increasingly likely.
Weekly chart. Lower highs, lower lows. Expect more of the same. Case dismissed.
well I remember buying btc at 3.5k USD where no one wanted it. I think 20k is what has been 6k for a while back then, 20k is a psychological barrier as well, but i think it will drop even below 10k with some headlines 
where are all the retards and moonboys saying Bitcoin will hit ATH soon? Last days were an authentic circus of clowns. You understand sh*t.
will go down
Will it break below 20K today?
you can always short bitcoin, cool
Dode has 8b market cap and Syscoin is at 100m ? crypto is a joke i swear
doge is going down
This coin should not exist. Maybe one of the biggest ponzi scheme  in crypto world. I'm sorry for people trust money. !
trash meme coin die finally
I am selling all my Dot, will buy back once it will reach $2.5
i think it will test the 4,85 USD resistance zone but i beleive it can go bullish in a further future because this is a greay project
Stupid team. They do not communicate with the community, reschedule meetings 2 hours before the start.  Coins are not redeemed, there are no volumes
wait and watch it will come down to $3.5
: 40% of the holders of ETH are longterm investors, or have large stackings or are hodl-ers. However, the merge will release 13 milion ETH, will it be sold or stacked again, but that depend on the fees and on the way its financed (leverage). The SEC will be going after the exchanges and DeFi. ETH and ADA are big, because of stacking.
: ETH will go up again, if the macro conditions will improve. See it form this perspective: ETH had al ATH price of 4750 dollars. If you buy ETH at 1400 dollars, it is possible that the price could drop by 50% to 700 dollars, but in a bullmarket it will increase tot at least 5000 dollars, an 350% rise in price. This is a low risk, high benefit position. Buy small, do not go in, all at once.
a typical pump and dump scheme, they take your money for electrronic money that you cant touch  you cant touch  no sense
again massive fake pump 
ahaha some salty kids reporting my post Bruhh his thing is dead 
bad news coming guys from the PRE-FED that means the stock market is going into the red
bearish on eth dumped at 1600 looking to buy back in at 800-900 if you think differently your parents are siblings
bearish signals. if you are bullish this week, don¡¦t blame the market when it drains your portfolio.
Bearish so incogneto the basement Dweller comments
BOOM!!  there it is wait dont buy right now lower lows 
BTC  follow $ETH  now. We don¡¦t need Bitcoin anymore and Ethereum is much more stable.
BTC $ETH whales manipulating the market again to steal your money
btc is going to take another leg down and is closing the week in red. everything goes with btc, eth will not be able to sustain these levels of gains and will have to consolidate lower. 
buying after fed announcement, too risky today
check my last post, more dip coming.. if you sold yesterday like I did, get ready to buy the dip..
classic bull trap 
crashing to 500$ than it will be  worth to buy :)
crypto crash This Week end until the FED announcement This tuesday ( ETH no must bleed so much before a biiiiiig pump to the moon in september with the merge and the stabilization of inflation) 
dang, $ETH just did over 2% dip within about a minute 
Developers making money out of announcements on twitter only to delay again each time they make millions while you poor people buy in to the hype. 
Dip is not yet done done listen to people saying buy and hold they are negative PNL they just want you to help redeem their high entry buy making you buy
don't get caught in the bull trap the market isn't ready for this movement wait a little
down, down  see you at 1060 next week.  invest smart ! 
dumping whilst I¡¦m dumping
enjoying the ride to the bottom
Ethereum developers etc made their money from this news announcement and will leave everyone in the dust only to delay again literally making money out of Twitter posts.
from here on till after tommorrows news the selling will begin carefull
get down to 1450
get out as soon as possible and buy back in @ 1300
going down!!!!!!
going down, the joyride is over
going to 1k again for sure
going to lose a massive amount traffic to $ADA. 
have you wonder how stupid sounds to buy a currency, lose money in fees, to pay for the same things that you was going to buy with your paypal account in dollars  to solve this issue, ethereum made smartcontracts, so you take your dollars, and buy ethereum, to pay the fees, for the second currency in smart contracts that you buy  so if you have 100 dollars, get ethereum and any other smartcontract currency, and you will have 97 dollars or maybe less, according to the smartcontract and gwei fees  haha
hope it dumps so I can get discount
I dont follow the "hype"...we wait
i fear an insane dump is coming..
I lost my hand and left....I am so sad and upset. I broke my monitor...I don't know why the market is crashing, I was so hot that I broke it...I lost my mind and lost my mind... Calm down now...it's so embarrassing... $BTC  
I think Ethereum will go back down to touch the final bottom and rocket up for the September Merge..
if btc down,eth double down!!!
If i buy, it will be between 750-1000 dollar. The macro economic situation is pretty bad. If the FED increases de interest rate with 100 bp, the cost of borrowing will increase dramatically. And quantative tighting is failling. The FED is making a loss of 500 billion dollars this year, and the loss will be transferend to de federal State. The taxpayer is going to pay for saving the banks, the expensive cars etc.
If you are bullish right now, I heard Mac Donald¡¦s is hiring bros that are down bad.
If you are buying now like I mentioned before, y'all going to get fckd in the a$$ without lube. DACing is the way! Sub 500 bucks incoming after merge.
it seems the bull has been slaughtered by the bear
it will bearish the price is really heavy now,, this pump is a last pump of this months,, believe or not that's will happen soon
it will drop to $1470 so it can pump even harder again
it¡¦s falling in abyss now 
Just another pump and dump. I sold everything and will buy back when the dump has arrived. U guys don't know how a bear market works, this is just FOMO and Scam from the whales. Don't get caught holding the bag. 
Just some thoughts for the CMC community... I'd be the LAST person to ever give out finacial advice hahaha so this certainly isn't... but I think stacking cash for your next ETH buy would be wise. I think a big crash is coming sub 1,000. Could be wrong! but man, what an oppertunity that would be! Almost doubling your buys from its current price point. Time will tell!
my intellect tells me bearish
old technology. New advanced and improved L1 blockchain technology on it's way and that's Pulsechain. A hard fork of Ethereum with a copy of the full system state. The biggest airdrop in crypto space. All the ERC20 in your wallet you get a exact copy on Pulsechain. I expect the Pulsechain launch within 7 months.
only bears insight, unless interest rates start dropping. 
people i don¡¦t understand why you don¡¦t do some research, the last beae cycle eth dropped 94% , do your calculations this bear market is more terrible then ever war , inflation the biggest, global economy in crisis, so 94% drop as the 2018 bear cycles means 200-400$ etherum 
recession soon down to $700
resistance at 1600 lets see if it breaks it 
same here, I¡¦m bearish on 
scam pump get out now
see you at 550 you useless piece of coin
sell all your Ethereum now, or pay the ultimate price
send it to hell, bear signal was given. very clear. 1200-1300 price range is what I¡¦m looking for. potentially $800-$900 with FOMC and stock market FUD
short term bearish  just Took profit , gonna dip wait and buy at lower levels 
sinking like I said a week ago ;)
Sold 50% of my $ETH  at 1600USD. If it goes down... good, i will rebuy around 1000USD. If it goes up... good anyway. And i will use the USDT to invest in other blue chips. I love this market cause it gives us new opportunities every single day.
still going down 
temp pump, wait for tomorrows growth news to show we are in a recession when it tanks. ETH reached this level last week 
that is true you can purchase on it now 
THERES A COOKIE AT THE BOTTOM 
this is a bear rally don¡¦t fall for it just yet wait to sub 950s to buy 
this is a bull trap. look at the entire crypto space and world economy. there is 0% that etherium will he the only asset in crypto that goes up. next week the fed rate hike will bring eth to $800. sell now and buy doubke in 6 days.

Only thing coming back is that extra zero

rubbish token , going nowhere 
this crap is nothing more than a pump n dump now 
this is way too funny to watch everyone having high hopes in a coin that is past dead. This absolute trash is already decayed and turned into dust and still people are saying it will hit 0,1 or 1
this lunc is shit
This people want to scam us again
will never go up, wake up guys 
you are all crazy. here in LUNC there are two types of investors. -those who bought high and now have lost everything -those who bought very, very cheap and who will never win anything. a great vicious circle closed. all run like puppies around the tail
always dumps harder than other crypto. shitcoin
Better invest in Avax
bull trap bull trap bull trap. sideways for a very very long time new 52 lows to come.
get ready for the crash... 15B market cap... the fall will be hard.. it will go below $18
going to below 35 within a week
hort bearish mode incoming 
I think another accumulation phase is overdue.. as well as a retesting of previous lows, this would be a preference for many; to allow confidence in buying and to FOMO in some bullish movement! We shall see soon enough what BlackRock & The U.S. FED have in store for us..
insecure and not scalable, it will vanish by next year
never catch falling knife
shorting for the night
such a bad project, 7 downtimes,  lying about supply several times, very centralized and self orientated token distribution and not secure at all. Everyone that knows about blockchains stays aways from Solana they work on a phone now instead of fixing their broken chain.
The worst blockchain ever, in the top 10,  How ironic.
worst blockchain, it can't scale, insecure...doomed to failure
definitely a stable coin 
fake pump. Will go back to .04
going to collapse one day suddenly
I guess the whole crypto market is going down more and more nothing positive 
a bad week for crypto, bonds and stocks.
it won't survive the court case 
peoples are just waiting for the sec case to be over so they can sell after the pump....this coin has no utility and it will fall after that event
shit coin $MDT is far far better than this
the bottom of price of this coin is unidentified yet, so it'll go lower. I am absolutely sure
bad coin it will not break out soon tho 
Buy moon and go to hell 
can believe this shits still alive lol
caution  book profit and exit two major factor 1) US recession 2) China - Taiwan conflict now on a face of war, China will follow Russian statics on Ukrain. pls save your money and have patience and look fwd to 2023 Q1.
Has everyone been fooled? Is Charles a snake oil salesman? There is no large whale money , or institutional money feeding ADA. It䏭 a lot of shrimp money. Do we really think that an upgrade (Vasil) will make ADA $1. I don think so. I think you are all being played . 
has never gone up after an upgrade.  There is always a sell off after each platform upgrade.  The price run up has already been priced in.  It will drop after the upgrade, you will lose then and it will be a long time before you make your gains back - hear me now, believe me later.
make me happy and go to the floor babe 
never invest to ADA INU if you not loose money :)
short term look for big losses. long term to the moon.
SOL your going to see $ETH maxipad in here trying to compare $ADA with $SOL. ADA never shuts off, ADA doesn't have lock up staking, ADA does give you failed transaction and still have to pay for fees, ADA can send multiple nfts, tokens and ADA and send to three wallets in onego.
this shit don't stop
will follow the US market - down, down, down over the recession  A major economic indicator hits Friday (jobs report), and the market will dive, crypto will follow through the weekend target:  .43 by Monday -- This recession will be a white collar recession.  Stay out of crypto until 2024  Hear me now and believe me later
you can be millionaire with doge but not this shit
bad tokenomics for the next years. you will be able to enter at 20$ in the next bear market if the project will survive.
its going below $20 tomorrow
scammy project. solunavax dropping like Flys. We're did the moon bios go what happen too this scammy project. lmaooo no one is building on solunavax anymore. 
Cracks beginning to appear, Binance will almost certainly drop out of top 10 next bullrun-Bearish
if it's bearish, i will consider it as an opportunity to buy at the low price.
Sorry,Binancese i Think There'll be 90% Percent HYPE Down Soon
We'll Be Below 89% Soon, Sorry For this
A word of advice stand still and observe  the bottom has yet to be touched.
after liquidate almost all shorter since 1 week is the turn of longers before they kill BTC be carreful guys 
another play pump and dump
bad month for the crypto with massiv fakepumps鴂
Brazil Cryptos.  hey guys. what䏭 your opinion on BTC trend for the near future ?  we think it䏭 bearish but who really knows what the future holds !?
bull trap be careful guys FED announces were not so good and SP500 companies balance sheet were not so good too.. look at the graph.. sp500 will go down soon, BTC follow sp500 and crypto market follow 
Chart on whale wallets show they are selling cause FOMO pushes the price up which is strategized by whales.  Why they sell, because they know we haven hit the bottom, where they will accumulate at cheap price.  Don FOMO at this point, be very cautious if you do. imo
China and Taiwan and economy collapse incoming.
dead cat rebound))
enjoy the bull trap my boys
ETH tanked, Volume is low, stocks will go down, so 
failed to stay above the 24K resistance. We will probably look for liquidity void (green) with support at 21700.
fake pump huge dump soon
fake pump it will go 20k soon
Fake Pump people getting salary in the next 3 days... nothing positive in the next coming up weeks :( In at least 20 days 10% down again $BTC $ETH $BNB $XRP $ADA $SOL $DOGE $DOT $LUNC $LUNA 
fake pump sell if you can
fake pump. still in the midst of crypto winter. going as low as 12k
FED... MTGOX...WAR... and this people its bullish. I dont undestand
fish and chips say bearish brev
Gays we must meet 16k,we really need this for really bullish market. 
get your chainmail gloves on everbody 
guys look at the charts of market especially the joker of crypto that is BTC its going down believe me will hit 17K sell now and buy down. 
here come the china-Taiwan tension watch out 
here comes the china-taiwan tension watch out guys
how do I withdraw my profits? 
I buy BTC in bulk if you wanna sell, at a very good rate. I think we might be dropping to 17K $BTC 
If doesnt break the 25k we will see the 19k
interesting analysis for bottom. 
it is a bear flag, it will come down. Seeing comments here covince me of that as you need buyers to step in and they still do. bottom is in when they run out of cash or give up or step in cautiously. sorry it is what it is.
it's gonna go back to 23k 
it's running out of gas ,, the rocket has fall down 
LEAVE THE SHIP NOW I REPEAT LEAVE THE SHIP NOW! NUMBER GO DOWN RED ALERT ! BUY LATER AGAIN WHEN NUMBER GO UP ! BUY HIGH SELL LOW !
LOL fake pump 
Moonboy tears keep flowing! Moonboys fail to understand there is no real cash moving through the system and most people are broke AF! BTC is trying to keep its head above water but in the end BTC will see 10K and below. It just takes time when you have central banks buying up the sotck market and bonds market.
ok bull session is done 
omg bearish again lol
OND $BTC $ETH Bond perfect example of the current market pump and dump. prepare also for big dump $BTC and $ETH.
performance is crap.
so today I will probably lose the BTC competition .  BTC is not moving to $ 26333.
soon major bull trap all the readings are waaayyy low!
still more to clear out before next big jump
The exit from the market begins. Whales sell, retail buys. I prefer to follow the smart money.
The FED increase correct 75%. USA Recession 
This is Fake Pump Trape very soon
time to vacate this proprietary relic for  ETH!
We hit almost the top of the bearish channel and SP500 faces major resistance in that region. As I said if SP500 continues the correction we will see $BTC  probably looking for 17K again.
yhea don`t look good at all.... Lets prepere guys for the winter!
𩤃 Nothing changes, more elements indicate that we have not emerged from an unstable and risky zone..
doge is just dying slowly. no utility like most other coins. no max supply, hopefully noone mints 6 trillion coins outta nowhere. sold out of this bad coin awhile ago. i need more utility than elon musk said its good.
hit rock bottom and wavy just like $BTC   and $ETH
price got below the 64-day simple moving average.  This is a bearish signal. Not mean to talk negative about this awesome coin, but let the great DOGE community take advantage to exit and potentially re-enter. 
ETH Everything what Ethereum have failed to deliver all those years, have $CSPR which is ETH v3.0 and $DOT already delivered and accomplished! 
it's just a bubble Dot will go down to $3
it's not doing what I thought it would. Parachain auctions not being faught for like I expected.. Some projects stagnated or died off etc
people that are buying this coin are pretty much inv3sting into cardano lmaooooooooooooooooooo polkadot took a coding from cardano white paper lmaooooooooooo 
, Its just another pump-dump by whales to fool you. The whole market is still on winter. I'm still believe $250-$400 is possible and then recovery starts, just set the chart to ALL time, and see the history.
640 is waving and stop listening to those who just want the market to move how they want it because it is what it is and it wont move according to what incognito says
a 100% return while macro only getting worse and USA is in a recession since two negative quaters, but FED and the white house won't tell you beacsue they need to hike more and reduce their balance sheet. In other words no retailer panic allowed until they executed their plans and midterms have occured. Big companies fire all from 2 to over 10% of their employees. Yet ppl think a bull run has started, holy shit you ppl are not going to make it...
And all the way back down
and down we go 
anyone who is for “slashing” is no different then a bank. people join crypto to unbank themselves and actually own their funds. money needs to improve. eth is going backwards.  
As a new day trader its nice to see some chats. I cant find a souk irl that knows about crypto. is there any irl friends to be made. People are oblivious to crytpo
Be Careful to Buy over 17..
Bearish because I’m bearish on Bitcoin and think in the coming days it’ll have much needed pullback. It can’t break critical levels of resistance I think we go back down to support before we go up to a new high
becouse it's testing
best time for anybody to buy 
BTC  $ETH  What we are not realising is that btc has lost A LOT of value, we are all saying it will go to 29k but isn't the case here, 29k is now 24k, like we can see ETH is back to where it was in May so is the S&P 500.
Btc has 2 top side... I think it will fall...So Eth does same movement
bull trap done. Big dump over the weekend.
die for me, baby
DOGE  hit rock bottom and wavy just like $BTC   and 
don't listen to this guy the only way the merge will effect eth price is if  it fails and i don't see that heppening when it come to the price no one know where it's gonna be tomrrow or after week it can go to 2000$ or 2500$ no sure info what i can insure you is eth going bellow 700$ before the end of this year it can get to even lower prices but no lower than 350$ 400$ at worst we never saw market drop with out some rally in price that's exactlly what's happening now don't get fomo keep emotions out my friend and defenetly take profits if you have any and never sell for loss if you have one go learn some thing called dollar everaging just google it it's gonna help you recover some or all your losses hope i helped you friend stay safe. ( english isnt my first language ' sorry ' )
dump dump dump incoming 
eth merge is coming not sure what to think. Any techys have any input. It's all about the climate right an global warming an energy consumption. since we care so much about that
Ethereum BIG FAIL! $CSPR is ETH v3.0 created by Ethereum developers! Why wait for ETH v2.0 that is probably never coming!? Casper is the real ETH killer and can easily rise to top 10-20 for 100x! Even $DOT is a better project than ETH right now!
Ethereum price will be cake who crush by big truck tyres
Everything what Ethereum have failed to deliver all those years, have $CSPR which is ETH v3.0 and $DOT already delivered and accomplished! 
fake pump ETH. Soon will go under 1k.
first Bull trap people…. you’ll understand in a couple of days!!!!! The macro economics is just not there and won’t be any time soon!!!
Get ready for Dump guys!Bull trap accomplished!
go down i want to buy more
hope go down to buy more. meanwhile DCA
I don’t think we gonna to recover the 900 like a few weeks ago but 1200/1350 why not.. a lot of fomo these times, DCA is the best option.. In anyway we’re still in bear market and nothing is done yet.
I love Ethereum… it is the Future boys and girls!!!! But it is about to fall hard and take a BigShit!!!!!
i said it will go down, and they report me, so i losty other account, it will duuuuump we gonna touch the 1200$ 
i swear on god it will duump i sweaaar sell guys if you have some profit, if not just hold it 
I understand everyone being so bullish but hope everyone also knows that we’re in a bear trend and this up trend can’t go on forever. We will be revisiting the lows soon before we Mooon again. Trade safe guys and don’t fall for these fake pumps!
i will sell my 1200 ETH now 
If you chase the bull you will get plowed. 
I'm bearish on ETH bc it can not send multiple nfts at once. please fix this. like can I send nfts tokens eth layer 2 coins in one go to four different wallets ? 
IMF Warns of Further Crypto Selloffs and More Coins Failing
it will dump a little in the next days. those who didn't bought thursday will have a  chance to buy again, no more than that, the merge is coming.
it will go down for while again,
It won't be bullish until it saw the dip twice or very close to it. In the short term it will fall but only to rise like never seen before. 
just sold all my eth, going to buy again once price drops.
KDA pow can be only $BTC  why do you think rhat $ETH changed from pow to pos??
looks like hard dump
looks like more and more people got bored of waiting to grow more.... and slowly more and more is letting go from holding tight for the flight
nope. a failed transaction on ETH and still have to pay fees. the only great thing about ETH is the second layer like matic. so bearish on this poor tech. 
Now Time To Dump 
ok bull session is done
ok, i m out #short
people who keep saying going up in bear market XD
sell, another pump is over
selll quick if u want to take ur profit its going down, 
still bearish until the merge. We might see sell the news with the merge. 
still not buying at these prices until merge happen. I am bearish on price but hopefully the merge is successful for ETH holders. good luck. 
the longer it moves sideways the more bearish it gets
The situation in China…
This is just the begining of the bear market and it will last minimum until end 2023 but don't listen the others do not sell but don't buy either!!!
time too take some gains 
waiting to buy lower
whatever you say im bearish now since thats what i see in the charts. dont push you ideas to someone do it for your own... though i trade on swing not on trend
why it’s not going down ?
will be killed by ada in short
will die a slow death and become extinct in the next 10 Years. ETH was a good experiment while it lasted. 
A epic failed project. just a pump n dump shitcoin now
Again going to. 000016 soon according of darkweb
Bearish -- mark my words.
Circulating supply keep increasing, Where burning is happening ??? They should declare Max Supply too immediately !!!
Destroyed me very very badly .. lost all of my life savings
Don't buy this shitcoin! Ponzi scheme!
everyone hyping this up because it 𢛴illed a zero but it䏭 still worth nothing and those expectations from all the guys who bought it at 80 dollar and just spreading false information so y緔ll buy is actually pretty cringe. 𠶧o the moon, when lambo retards ong
Fake Pump people getting salary in the next 3 days... nothing positive in the next coming up weeks :( In at least 20 days 10% down again $BTC $ETH $BNB $XRP $ADA $SOL $DOGE $DOT $LUNC $LUNA 
going down for short period.
hi guys, please be careful, big holders sold more than 10% and lending rate of US was increased so i expect i will be down soon, 嚜禦anage your money
hodl this while other crypto gains big,  嚜篤ho promised you burns, what do you think luna 2.0 money grew on trees
Lmao funny how people still believe in this sht coin after all of this  y緔ll are saying that it䏭 gonna go back up to $ 1 lmao let me tell you something it will never go back to the price it was before the collapse btw ik it was a lot more than $ 1 anyway keep dreaming.𤏪
no need to buy this anymore....
pump and dump scheme
Sell this shit coin. don't invest your hands salary on this! stop dreaming of being rich!
sold my Lunc and bought $TLM it looks like better option to get 10x if not more! Im not gona invest in $LUNC anymore for a hope to get 3x-5x.
This shit is dead get real!
#SOL  is said to have been hacked. true or not bad news affects the price.
$BTC  $ETH  $USDT  Dumb sol now or be sorry
3 million hacked today on solana network
About to Dump real hard but Bullish Long term
all coins will go down until the end of August, if not the year.
Attention Over 8000 wallet hacked will go to 1usd
Bearish short term but longer term Solana will break ATH without doubts. DYOR.
blockchain down again and all wallets are hacked! what a joke. this project is rubish
buy $SOL so you can get hacked
crap coin #1, regular outages. I prefer $ADA  or even $ETH  over that $SOL  garbage.
Crap security and a baby chain
don・t buy this rubbish it・s currently being hacked. Wallets are being drained.
DON'T BUY PROOF OF STAKE COINS GUYS. THEY ARE GOING TO GO DOWN SOONER OR LATER. 
dropping, expect 35
enough hacks to make it crash
Fake Pump people getting salary in the next 3 days... nothing positive in the next coming up weeks :( In at least 20 days 10% down again $BTC $ETH $BNB $XRP $ADA $SOL $DOGE $DOT $LUNC $LUNA 
For the growth of the cryptocurrency market, this waste must be eliminated.
get hacked, network down and more to come?
Going down for sure. Buy at 35 hopefully
going down to 25, time to sell, will buy once the target hits to restock. After the major news, the tech will be working on fixing the issue, in the meantime to prevent further losses, sell is the best option, waiting for the coin to stablize.
going to 7$ sell as soon as possible
Going to dump hard. Sell now!!!
hacked... go out so fast you can -> 0
has been totally compromised. They can steal ur tokens out of ur private wallet. U don't need to connect to anything for example. They just steal ur Solana by hacking the WHOLE blockchain. Look at the news, Solana js biggest scam of 2022. Garbage
how is the price in the green today with a 3.4M dollar scheme? ignorant money buys solana. #MATIC #ETH #SAND #BTC 
I really dont understand why the people buy and buy this total crap coin! 7 outages for 1 month. Now - this. And daily volume - 1,4 bln. How stupid the people can be to buy this crap. Its absolutely worthless piece of...crap, just like Cardano - promises, lies and troubles, but the people say - Ethereum killer. These 2 craps, teir presence in top 100 is a insult for the market at all. There are so many better projects than this scam and total crap. The exchanges should delist them right away, just like they had to do that with Luna and UST much before they gain huge market cap and tank all into the craps where they belong.
I'm losing hope for this coin
is finished. Constant outages and hacks
is the waste of time and money for now. avoid trading in it. if you hodl for long term then switch to another fundamentally strong coin.
it takes two days too unstake just wait for the drop. maybe buy the brick solunavax cellphone lmaoooo
it's gonna be all over
It's over for Solana, $20 by the end of the day.
just put this shitcoin out of its misery. another exploit.
let's make a bet that solunavax is going to turn off 
like luna .. just yesterday a hacker stole from sol network 572m
lol shit coin...
No soul left!!
oh crap I though this blockchain turn off ? yall heard about the new solunavax that the vcs building ? just wait until a bull market comes you'll see it. 
poo coin .  The Network more down than up ,network getting slow and congested  , DDOS Attacks make the network go down for few days sometimes!?!? This is really not acceptable!   I really don't know why Solana is still in Top10...
probably going to zero anytime soon. 
SCAM... Just short this ...
Scamcoin looking at the complete history
security is compromise go 0
sell this shit, it's going to 3 bucks
SELL!! , I have been hacked LOST MY FUNDS!!!
SOL has a big hacking problem right now, seems like the ecosystem has flaws which allowed some private keys to be stolen. Wallets drained as we speak, as we know wallet addresses are public keys and if you have the private keys you can drain them out. A cache of PK was discovered and keys stollen. I saw on twitter a lot of people moving to #Internet  Computer which will integrate Bitcoin in September.
sol wallet is been hacked 
That's what you get for having fast transactions, shit security. What a train wreck.
this badly designed chain will leave the top 10 in the next few months. It's becoming irrelevant due to its flaws
this is going back to 2 bucks, horrible chain design, done by bad developers
This is not blockchain, it is scammers Chain . Never invest a single penny on this garbage. 
Thousands of Wallets Attacked on Solana, Millions in USD Stolen (UPDATED)
Time to cash out SOL boys.
told you a hack or a shutdown in network will happen. this blockchain its still in beta and not buying it until improvements on network. it's not a secure network. so bearish. 
Totally loss trust
under 20$ this week !Big hack more then 200 milion dolars steal from Solana Wallet!
Warning that some wallets are being drained of $SOL tokens, what can be done to prevent this whilst waiting for a fix? Revoke app permissions from your Phantom wallet perhaps?
will done ..70% run out 
Will fold, drop. 29$ targets
will solana even last this bear market? Project so so centralized it hurts. They literally have a button that says "reset" and they click it and turn off the blockchain whenever they like. Blockchains are supposed to be never ending... Its a shame because I usee to like this project before they used to turn it off every night.
will tank. Weak chain.
worst chain, rushed and badly design from the core
$USDD say good bye to your money!! Ponzi, scam , shit coin
CBX  is not decentralised, it is working for early investors only .. sharing critical insights to them .. classical example of inside trading. It was $TRX, then $CBX and now $USDT  .. CBX has 0 purpose and the goal of the team seems to entertain trade bots for leverage trading
DO NOT BUY!!! The secrets behind Tron TRX has been revealed!!! Big dump coming soon!!!
tron scam is being left behind
caution  book profit and exit two major factor 1) US recession 2) China - Taiwan conflict now on a face of war, China will follow Russian statics on Ukrain. pls save your money and have patience and look fwd to 2023 Q1.
i will laugh at you innocent people.. 
im surprised people still invest in 
it is the next luna.
it will dump soon.
it's definitely melting my wallet and not my face...
not fast enough.
Simply too centralised. Bearish. DYOR.
soon xrp will loose lawsuit. 
The concept of XRP is outdated, there are multiple other coins that accomplish what XRP can do.  If it wasn for this prolonged lawsuit, nobody would be talking about XRP. 
the wortst token I have ever seen. 
will fall after the sec case, there will be a massive sell off, if you check the code it has many issues to scale properly
all crypto up,this shit no,omg what must be stupid to have ada :
bottomed at 2 cents in 2020 now trading at 51 cents? where is the support? thats why i dont think bears are done...
Great excitement for the project, bearish for august, however. Similar behavior with $BTC. Expecting pump and recovery in Q4.
holders attention, the price got below the 100-day moving average. This is a bearish signal. We 㓟ELL, sorry Cardano Fans! If you love the project, consider this news and buy back later.
I defended this coin until now i can no longer trust Hopkinson and his roadmap when majors events alre ways postponed.
nothing happening soon 
Nothing of significance or relevance being built on ADA. Besides retail hodlers on r/cryptocurrencies, no one talks about ADA. This is easily the most overhyped coin in the top 10. Days are limited.
This is not good. Institutions have no trust in ADA. Charles has to try to make deals in Africa. This is not working. People have lost a lot of money in this project. It䏭 really sad. 
I bought it when it was $54 now I・m stuck to that poop coin, don・t know what to do with it 
sell all market going down
Selling all my AVAX now and buying back at 22. The correction is coming and will be harsh.
this centralized trashchain is way overpriced at 26...it will vanish after Solana's incoming fall
centralized chain, not good
centralized shitchain, it willbe killed by ada
has his own dollar busd , if busd goes down also bnb will go down. Same situation like luna ?Just asking for a friend :))))
is centralized. Do you want an asian guy controlling your finances?
it will be take a small correction
the flood is sweeping 𢛶
the price will crash just short 
today Inflation Numbers in the U.S be aware!!! 
will go down soon 𪊶
18000$ remove your money from market 
as i said earlier,macro is shity and Black Rock gonna buy BTC cheap...𣸮
be careful we'll this time down btc
bye bye see u next year 
china-Taiwan , Russia-Ukraine  wait for the sloppy ride down the hill
DEAD CAT BOUNCE. BULL TRAP. By Dec or Q1 Q2, BTC will range btwn 12k to 8k and all alts will bleed out by then. Then that would be the bottom. Meanwhile STAY OUT !!! DO NOT FOMO in crypto. It's the fastest way to die.
every pump is being sold , volume dangerously low. turns out we are all just exit liquidity. you know what's coming...
fake pump or real sign? 
fake pump take profits and out 
fools have taken over the market big burns coming 
Going down, just like that counselor made you do at camp that time.
hese moon bois really need to wake up and realise that we are in a bear market. ATH wont come until atleast 2024 during the bitcoin halving. BTW before any numnuts starts attacking, I sold close to the previous ATH, while all you were holding and waiting for "$100K bitcoin at the end of the year" in 2021, pathetic. 
I read about so many crypto companies filing for bankruptcy right now.  hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their investments or are waiting to recover their money... we can make some money, but lets face it: we need a reset. 20k, 17k and even 14k will be reached this year. so good luck, guys!
I think it's still a wrong time to invest 
I told you, dump was waiting until today. 
If BTC don't break this weekend at least the line 23.80 k It will validate the bear market so guys lets ready to short our baby.
If Congress adds money to the economy = more inflation + Bitcoin will go up temporarily but then the Fed will raise rates again and Bitcoin will go down. I don脌 buy Bitcoin, I borrow it and hedge my loans with futures! I only do overnight trades through Pen Bancorp! 
it耱l go down cuz of war𪊶
June 5 to june 9 pattern, Im short. Buying the dip soon.
market kicked me out thank you #btc 
more likely to tank sorry moonboy sometimes you need to be a bull and sometimes bear lol it is nearly validate it is the bear market lol
Oh No dump
price is 100% manipulated bitcoin had a big dip then recovered but then erased the dip off chart
sideways and down before it pumps a bit again. day trading is the key. excelent VOL to make money.  jus as we do with good Stocks with high VOL. We don脌 seat on it and wait. we trade !
Someone is trying REALLY HARD to keep BTC at 23K..and this is why i know its going to go down and down hard. If you look at the on chain data..there is next to no real activity that shows growth on the network. Transaction volume is way down.. all bearishness aside i think this is going to tank soon right along with the US stock market that is high on crack right now..
The price keeps bouncing in a tiny range; it like watching ping pong. Amazing what robots can do these days!
they added some tokens to circulation supply and see the volumes when bullish market for 80k volume the price rise almost 3000 but now 210k volume it is just raising 1600 now it is very pathetic.
we going down baby 
whoever who controls BTC just a son of a b!tch 
why is this not stable like the all year is a waste 
BTC, ETH, MATIC all serve a need & accomplish things and earn money.  DOGE coin and other flim flam useless coins that have accomplished nothing will be outlawed soon and fall by the wayside. Fed・s are carving out crypto regulation laws now so be warned 
DOGE is a garbage coin it does nothing, it hasn・t accomplished anything, it・s sheer lunacy to invest in it.  Smart money is on MATIC Polygon. 
i just got off the phone with Elon. He is a very good friend of mine, and we discuss Doge from time to time. well guess what, he's gonna dump it all. I'm telling u now so u can save your money!
memecoin is goin to zero
people lost everything with this crap stay away
has one of the worst tokenomics with unlimited supply. Totally centralised project. The team has no proper model. They changed the supply limit multiple times. Can't wait to watch the supply to hit 5 billion. I feel sorry for those who say the price will hit 400 usd.
messy project!  according to an expert on crypto banter.  I suggest selling now!
might be a scam ?
same volume But Price Getting Pump Dump Badly
Too Much loss in #DOT 
will be destroyed by nervos network midterm in the field of interoperability....
1 .5k too 1 .7k best short of my life in this bear market. 
1100$ will hit in 2-3 weeks, don't walk in bull trap!!!!
500 will be the bottom 
Am I going to need to do anything with my eth coins once the merge happens? I'm hearing about a fork etc.
and there goes the pump
another fake pump. That's number 4. How many more must there BE!?
back to 1 .5k ?! then buy again too short ?! or dump more ?! 
bearish af fake pump
bearish, may not fail but certainly will not do as well as others long-term
derish coin... not bad!
dump it guys plsss, so we can get a chance too!
ETH WILL NEVER FLIP BTC. THATS A PUMP AND DUMP RUMOR. 
fake pump again and again and again 
Fake pump, be aware!
firts warnings of a drop . just saying 
Funny to witness people still high on hopium since the hyperbolic run that started out in late 2020. Let me tell you this, when the real bear market hits¡K there won¡¦t be any conversations¡K for many years. Utter silence is yet to come. Stay woke and then you will win the game
I think they will push back the merger. Just fomo, they will do it when it's a bull market.
is slowly losing hodlers...ppl are starting to realize the merge wont solve high fees or anything at all apart from being more energy efficient
it's a shitcoin bc you have to own other shitcoins to move this shitcoin around. when BTC all you need is BTC. 
like I said short eth and follow through miners. ETC will moon. let's troll these ETH maxipads that ETC is the better tech lmaooo pump it !!
looks like hard dump
managment, great team. To the moon?-Why not? Buy now its not too late #GulfCoin #Gulf_Coin $GULF 
merge isn't what almost everyone think
merge will be a failure. Can't wait. 
my rate is higher 
new short bottom will be 1 .6k then push back up. August is always red for most crypto. 
now. Great project, positive vibes and results. 
S1: 1450$ S2: 1310$ S3: 1260$  Ethereum Futures remained in backwardation
Scammity scam pump
Sell now everithyng  while you can
short eth until the merge 
SOL  $BTC  $ETH  $USDT  $USDC  $BNB  SELL YOUR SOL the chain is too new and will continue to have massive insecurities and issues, and slow transaction speed
soon will go down , miners will start selling exactly before merge
the bears will take over
To Many hacker . Some $1.83 billion has been stolen from bridges to date, with the majority of that ($1.21 billion) taking place just this year, according to Elliptic. I dont Trust
took gains. it's a fake pump. will see crypto has a whole dumping. more dumps then riase. incogneto is my bihs has well. lmaoo dude has no life. short eth. wait for the merge. ETH has a failed transaction you pay for that. you need to send eth buy other shitcoins like matic.
we are going downnnn
where are all the bears? come on
while the price of ETH is going down.. The price of GULF is going up..
will be replaced by ada. The account model is not scalable to serve millions of users and the merge wont solve anything in terms of fees
all you delusional bottom feeders.: This epic failed project will not suddenly make you rich. Not with a burn not with anything. pump n dump now
Depreciation on daily basis? 嚜燙mall digression in BTC, bigger falling in lunc that's the Chemistry. 嚜篤hen lunc was on 0.00016, I thought it could do better, bought at 0.00013 but has since fell consistently till now. 嚜澦ow can I be bullish about it?
every couple of days I come here just to check if there are still any fools left investing in this dead, abandoned scam coin..
everything about luna or lunc or whatever is going on is wrong. it was a scam that went too far and ended in a majestic rugpull. people should move on, no need for new products from something that allready burned you. i lost a lot of money on that bs...
guys stop holding onto a Ponzi scheme Luna isn脌 exploding it died out and I don脌 think people are Willng to go back in so stop
I sold all my Luna !
My fellow LUNC holders, as much as I would love to see this at $1, truth is this: (a) you are being mislead by PR machines like HCC which tries to keep your hope alive to make you hold and others invest more into LUNC BUT truth is and you feel it, you loose money on this coin if you look on the big picture (b) PR machines like HCC piggy back ride on your genuine hope that this will rise whilst they monetize you using Youtube, Twitter, NFT etc and so them are the winner not you (c) as you can notice terms when this is to go to moon is changed from August to September, then to December and so on. The minute you stop trusting this PR, the game is over. My opinion only!
STC $LUNC don't wait for your good fortune with these two siblings down to zero no future at all
The biggest epic failure in crypto history is nothing more than a pump n dump scheme now. With an occasional flatline LUNC= shitcoin
this crap is dead get real
this crap is nothing more than a pump n dump scheme now 
this lunc is Dead, The team only need to promote luna v2 to recover the company value, every day the supply of this is increasing.
WOO  'zero-fee' trading and unsustainable returns? This is sounding so much like $LUNC . Obvious scam.
$BTC  $ETH  $USDT  $USDC  $BNB  SELL YOUR SOL the chain is too new and will continue to have massive insecurities and issues, and slow transaction speed
crash after crash after Solend fund stealing after wallet hack¡K.and yet people still support this coin. I would say it¡¦s sad but now it¡¦s just pathetic.
crash system solana, scame potention
de most centralized coin in crypto
dump this shitcoin and get some PulseChain when it comes out¡K thank me later!!!
has good future but hackers are gonna sell more and price gonna go more down. sell asap
have lost lot money from this shit, better sell now ,than regret later
how many times do you need to get hacked or system shut down I really don¡¦t understand why sol  keeps meltdown few signs of titanic with faulty engine means not your key not your coins jump while you can before not financial advice fat lady is not singing yet save yourself.
i didnt understand buying...
I never got into ADA & SOL, they're taking to long to get anywhere
is absolute garbage
just a shitcoin
just sold sol for quant
Not even inculding the hack, solana is too young of a network and far too ambitious, dont expect conscestantcy, and it may even die out in the next year
sell to cut your losses before it hits 0
SHIT COIN, SELL THIS SCAM
shitcoin with shit volume
shitcoin, volume down 50%
slowly but surely solunavax will fall out of top 10. I feel like polkadot should be top 10 by now. polkadot hasn't shut off bc they used one of cardano white paper lmaooo man feels good not chasing moon boi coins/tokens/high yeild/staking thru rugg pull exchanges (Voyager). 
Solana and it's fake TVL lol 
Solana has to really tighten up their Security 
soluna is about to go 20% dip after the hack, there are sell orders for massive amounts
sometimes I wish I could just turn back time and not have invested. I¡¦m happy I didn¡¦t pour my life savings into this! what a shit coin this is. wow!
there are much better layer 1 solutions out there with way more upside potential. SOL is centralized and unstable, outright overvalued. DYOR!
This gonna be next LUNA maybe the crash will not be so big but still this coin will die until next bullrun 
this shitcoin has 200 days at the most before the big downward spiral to the crypto graveyard
too many flaws in their core code, bad software design, it can't scale up or serve millions of users , it wont make it
Too young, gonna crash, dont say you werent warned
under 20$ this week !Big hack more then 200 milion dolars steal from Solana Wallet!
will not survive another 6 months. It's Going down hard 
You will lose if you buy this right now
$USDD say good bye to your money!! Ponzi, scam , shit coin
was a good project but know I dunno...
Aahahahahha big scam!
is centralised coin, go look for what䏭 better don脌 lose money on this I脎e spent years that䏭 my conclusion 
is going down, only one utility which is not unique at all, other chains does it better...after the sec trial it will go to 3 cents
now a hater this coin is dog
Piece of shit coin.. The ceo dumps on all you guys, hes an egotisical maniac had many oportunities to settle with the SEC
this shit can't move
xrp to the dustbin....
11-13k in a couple months? or is it only up from here 
22k soon cause I told u so moonboys
573.00 bearish Big swap and dump for multiple altcoin rallies is about to happen. i've been watching 24/7 for 3 weeks. WARNING...
95% is owned by developers. As soon as sec trial finishes they will sell
ada will flip bnb in short. This centralized chain is nothing compared to ada
after merge huge crash, people will realize the fees are the same as before, and same old problems will continue, not scalable(account model). Stick to ada
After the ETH merge ADA will lose half it's value
after the hack people just lost confidence
after the hack ppl lost trust in this
AHF  FOR EVERYONE THAT LOST AND CANT SELL COME JOIN THE $LUNAT  COMMUNITY AND GET 4% REWARDS AND HELP BURN $LUNC  JUST BY HOLDING $LUNAT
Alert trapping now ready to dump. stand by,  $15 soon
All gains from 90 days will be gone today 
always hack. Warning
always more down...noooo
another hack coming soon 
anyone still buying this deserves to lose your money. I tried warning yall back in March that do Kwon was being shady and look what happened. Now yesterday in his interview with coinage he basically admitted he rugpulled everyone, and that he's sorry. 鴂鴂
back to reality. we're still in a downtrend
Bank owned. google ethereum alliance. you welcome
Be prepared for the next big dip! 
best choise to loose money
big drop coming soon, eth merge wont stop it
BIG DUMP AFTER THE MERGE.... Bear market havent even started yet :) see u in 2 years boys.... bye
big dump is coming
big pump done next big dump
Big pump was good, but in the next weeks we will have a big dump
big selloff incoming after sec trial, it will never recover after that since the whales are xrp creators and they can't wait to get rid of their tokens(95% of supply)
bitgert will replace it in the coming years
btc going up, lunc going down. why??
btc hanging with a thread hold your dollars in your bucket 
BTC will surely come to 22k....Market was in very good condition since last 27th September to 14 August 
Bulls are in full denial, sell while you can.   You got a clear warning from me yesterday that the weekly looked like shit and was about to fall over a cliff. Will you listen this time around or are you gonna hold this position as well down to new lows?
Careful. Market Makers are probably going to rip faces off as we break through the 1900 level. Friday is profit taking. This could be a Stop Hunt high¡K.and a nice flush of weak shorts. We will know by 4pm.
centralized shit, asian guy will rugpull eventually
centralized. This is account based, non scalable, I keep warning about this. Solana will not make it. Stick to ada
Chuck Norris can turn off the $SOL  network. But he doesn't have to, it does that itself.
crap token for crap people
Degenerates are pushing this Coin. Be aware of bearish reversal.
Do NOT fomo. It's just a bear rally. Wait for Dec to Q1 Q2, ETH likely will be 588 to 788, and BTC 12k to 8K, and most alts bleed 60 to 80% more to death. Then that's the probable bottom, but will still depend if inflation is tamed to 4 to 5%.
doesn't have any future, the chain was hacked constantly and with a lot of downtime. The team is not reliable either, just junior developers selling an idea
Doge must die! Stay away this.
dot and solana were hacked, you cant trust your money to these noob chains....stick to ada, the only one that has never been hacked
Elon musk will put billions of dollars into dogecoin this year 存ell your bitcoins and buy dogecoin..and thank me later confirmed
eth 2.0 will flop regardless what ADA dose its not possible for the model to be sustained for a long period of time hence the delay .. just a heads up unless you get in early avoid that 1
expect a crash up to 50% soon...
fake it until you break it pump
Fake pump will crash to $800-$1000$ETH 
giving up on this coin, earning less profit better than a big loss. These two days pump will have a huge negative impact on its price. 
go to the moon buy the dip lets go
going down. Network fails every time,  look at the facts! Head and Shoulder will give us a nice short opportunity.
Going to be dip down sale fast
Going to down again..be alert
gonna go back to 20k range
guaranteed shorting this after it goes up another 100. market manipulation done by the big players. when it falls down then I¡¦ll buy spot.
Guys,let's put some stats when we try to make some predictions. Based on Dune Analytics, ETH price doubled in the past two months,While newly added smart contracts were less than 300K in the past two months(It's 2.7M the same time period last year).Besides, the Gas is around 6Gwei now. All of them showed a weak on-chain activities, how can we expect a pump in a short time ? Begin DCA on the neckline is a good strategy.It's around 1800 now
hacked dot will be destroyed by nervos network in the field of interoperability
has shitcoin writter all over it
Have people forgotten that we are on the very brink of a recession happening or let alone at start of one? Meaning all forms of investments such as stocks, index funds, bonds and crypto are gonna be stagnate and very bearish for the next couple of quarters or years. There is a pretty decent chance this is a fake pump and is gonna return back to where it was in june. There is evidence that supports this in previous recessions (look at the 2008 economic collapse)
Heading to 300 new low
Here come the dump
Here we go again.
How do people who store LUNC do not understand that while they have tens and hundreds of millions of this token on their balance sheets, the price will not rise to $1! The market has always earned smart, not stupid! Do not rely on the fact that many will become millionaires, this will not happen!
I heard it'd going to turn off again the end of this month. 
i Hope more chances to buy cheap btc over dollar cost averaging will come soon 貫衅
I just don¡¦t like Joseph Lubin 
I Sold so it's bearish
I think it will dump big time 
if it hits 2 .1k I'm selling. All of it and jumping into other layer 1s that miners are mining. everyone is aiming to sell at 2 .2k 
if you care for your future financial situation please sell Solana, it's really easy to see it already failed
If you look at the 4H chart you could see a bear flag. This is my TA and could be completely wrong, let me know what y'all think!
if you zoom out to monthly, you can see eth did almost the same in 2018 from april to may what it did now from july to august. I personally expecting a further drop.  Stay safe and dyor
I'm out for now, but will jump back in with any signs of life
insecure network, the code is really bad, go take a look for yourselves
is a food that makes you dream. Like Alice's Wonderland.
is a shit coin ran by a bunch of satan worshippers 
is done, nothing more to say about this unreliable and unscalable chain
is going down
is losing the sec trial, check discord
is mostly owned by creators. Once the sec trial finishes, they will wait the pump and sell everything. It will crash to 10 cents and never recover
is owned and controlled by bankers
is still very much bearish. So just a technical correction before we move 15/19k to buy because there are no good news on the market that can move btc up. So I'm just trading short.
is the next luna coin....
is the worst chain. It uses the account model which is not scalable at all, it will be killed by ada soon
it can keep going up in the bear market. it¡¦s not over. short it 
it may be go down 
it works from Monday to Friday 10AM to 19PM and rarely on Weekends
it¡¦s going down to $1830
its dead c'mon now.
its going down again. too many dumps
it's going down to 1880 again
it's gonna dump to 23
last day for sell
lol price for this shitcoin is so inflated everyone is going to sell after the merge, we will fall harder than you can imagine
makes sense why the richest man sold. I联 bearish in a bearish cycle. keeping my money in the bank first
market capitalization of this coin is 623 million. value of the coin is currently 0.000095. to double this amount high someone has to deposit 623 millions at luna money and then the value rises to 0.00019 .and what fool is going to do that??
Maybe after all the de-pegs, it's a sign to stop buying stable coins. Maybe dollar or any other irl currency in a crypto form wasn't a good idea after all.
Network that the only use is just to pump and dump jpegs
Never in his life will he catch up with his competitor. nor a good advertising company. no change of leadership will help. Gently smoothly down. smart contracts did not take root. nft marketplaces are not viable. enough to support this stillborn project?
noob developers running the project. They patch things up on the go, this is done. Stick to ada
Ok, it have a burn so what? Your money will burn faster here!
old fashion shit
people with no idea about coding keep pumping this coin like if it was the holy grail, they are in for a world of future dissapointment
possibly very low price. don脌 lose more. sell buy low and double your btc
Powell announces more hikes needed. look out below. yikes. 
rates are going to go up way more than expected at end of year in US and europe because of oil shortage. Crypto will be dirt cheap for several months. summer next year things will be much better
Scam that the founder was involved in
See, it goes down, certainly bearish, Im shorting this BTC all the way down! I will sell each pump, thank you!
sell and buy when the market cap  is some millions not possible for anyone now burn 500 millions 
sell everything scam 
sell it all, dot has been hacked, ausd depegged...insecure chain, stick to ada, the only network that has never been hacked...
sell it before you lose
sell sol buy avax
Shitcoin as always 
So, inflation is at one of the highest rates. benchmark interest rate is up to the skies, poverty everywhere, US is provoking China openly, and there are a lot of desperate and stupid people claiming that BTC value will grow imensly. How stupid can you be to believe this crap, I mean, aside "investing" your yearly holidays' money and stay at home at 40 degrees Celsius in a polluted city, hoping that BTC will reach 100k when it is obvious that there is no more money in the market? Go big, starting mid-September BTC should be right it should be: under 1000$. Then sell your houses, increase your mortgages, redirect your wifes to onlyfans, and claim: bullish!!!
solana is scam project sell
Solana ROI 8849.94% it will dump soon
solana shutchain is losing adoption by the second. Whales wanna pump it to get out. It will fall in short
sold all my eth 2 days ago. Not trying to play waiting game to reach max. profit. Now I just wanna buy more eth.. when has there ever been a moonshot without a falling shortly after
soon 30$ don't buy. it is a fakeout. Whales are playing trap.
stay away from this non scalable chain. It uses the account model, it will collapse when it reaches 300 million ACTIVE users
stop wasting Time on btc
story token, everyday new story what a sht.
The 7 day is so ready to fall of a cliff...  Rip late bulls that bought above 1.9k  Index went for an inane rally and so did ETH, however the king BTC does not lie, not even up to 28k to reclaim prev dump...   Everything looking weak as hell.
The bearish scenario of the bitcoin this month only the time give us the right answer. 
the bears are back in town 𦅚𦅚𦅚
The big question is: When will miners sell all their ethereum!? It seems they don't have another alternative, they simply can discard thousands of hardware, they will have to take profit of this pump, then invest and mine other mineable GPU coins, that eventually will grow i.e.: another ethereum fork, ETC, BitTube, Ubiq, Grin, etc.... What do you people think?
the bottom will be in November/December in my opinion, after the mod term elections. lets see
the crypto community needs to move away from $BTC it䏭 to controlled and centralized now !  before institutional money in game crypto was fun to be innow this Sh*t is ran by some rich dummies , who claim they will live on Mars one day 榀𩐳 
the hack affected dot pretty badly.
The hard fork to PoS will devide the community and the inevitable regulatory crackdown on DeFi with its illegal derivatives/securities trades will be the doomsday.
the merge wont solve anything, still high fees and ethereum will have to go through matic for EVERY transaction to be cheap. Specially when you are signing a contract or doing some operation that requires more gas. The pronostic is pretty terrible, enjoy this little pump
the merge wont solve anything. High fees for everyone, let's rely 100% on matic....when we reach 400 million active users lets collapse together
there is a reason why Elon Musk sold. Why miners reducing mining rigs. why why why why why why, the f price is crashing DOOM!!!!
there is so much investment from wallstreet now that when the stocks crash, btc and crypto will tank hard. As they will pull their portfolio out of high risk assets. This gradual incease in stocks and crypto always seemed illogical, but now im pretty certain a huge dump is coming.
this is zionist coin... huge scam comin up soon!
this shitcoin has 200 days at the most before the big downward spiral to the crypto graveyard
This shitcoin was the biggest failure in crypto history. You bottom feeders will never get rich. Its a ded shitcion
This token is like a trap tool when you enter, you must be trapped in a loss, this is the owner's game
this will drop down like a turd in a bowl
to the moon! but this is a dead cat bounce, it will drop again. watch out
totally shitcoin coin dump hard more likely.. peoples start dump now
trapping now ready to dump. .. stand by ..$15 soon...
trust has been lost in this unreliable chain, time to sell
venture capitals are waiting for this to pump so they can exit....they already saw the outages and hacks and knows that it's a bad investment...just by looking at the code you can tell it's made by junior developers...stick to ada
was breached and easily hacked, protect your investment gents and take your money out, these developers are juniors
way overvalued, will lose huge market share soon
We are close to one of the biggest crises in history. The energy crisis this winter will be devastating for Europe. The US that led the world for decades is now a country without a future and China is against bitcoin.
what is support level for low. looking for another buy position
when stocks increase by 1 %, btc increases by 1% too. This is bearish and proves that investors do not trust bitcoin or market or both. I am not touching btc if it trades like stock. when recession hit, it will be hard-hit, harder than stocks
why people put their money in a sinking ship? It's a coin without any development, just community with a gazillion of supply. Wake up people!!
will be sliding into a bearish zone
will be the next LUNA
Will Dump Soon
Will dump Very Soon Becareful
will go down badly 
will not survive another 6 months. It's Going down hard 
will not survive much more time, it"s an account model blockchain after all and full of bugs and security holes
You guys are so sensitive when you're met with the truth. I'd say thats a bit alarming. 
You're welcome to comment your personal predictions for upcoming months, gentleman.
 A lot of fake comments here for last months... 瘸nyway, this old luna token has 0 utility after the fall. It's now just a pump&dump trash.
 cardano holders are so arrogant.  That they cannot download a cardano browser wallet and test a dapps like minswamp.  Where you get 10k btc for 1 ada. they are absolute blind to reality. haha but it is FUD hahahaha
Cardano is losing active wallets. 
Cardano will be out of the top 10 this year 
Charles on Twitter "we're having a tough time upgrading everything, this may not work, but I'm giving you a heads up so when the boat goes down you can't blame me"
Dead tech, never reach it's ath again. If they can't get the fork working it's RIP.
even crypto analysts have said that this is an old tech chain and will be replaced
huge gains in the market today. ADA isn脌 moving. Get ready for a huge sell off. 
I found a lot of coins better than ada in my opinion that's my right to say it!
i see a huge dump
In business there is a saying: There's the quick and the dead, ada is the second one. 
is just the way to go , their staking mechanism is just amazing
no movement at all. Big trouble in little Cardano 
nobody know how to code in haskell so ada will never see any development. Its outdated anyways. get out while u can
people bought at 2 dollars. DCA all the way down. its now at 0.45 cents.
centralised shittttt !! It،¦s the grandpa of Luna coin as well. Get out ASAP & thank me later. 
This is essentially a centralized PoS Ethereum. It suffers from mostly the same problems as Ethereum since it's EVM based. The only diffrence I can see is the fact they traded decentralization for speed. (Like most other "ETH killers") And 42% of the initial supply went to the team, while only 16% went to the public sale. I'll say it: It's a VC pump and dump.
centralized garbage coin, stick to ada
Fake pump, 90 % of bnb own by Binance and Whales. we can t move the price.  Thursday to 240 $ . Be careful
Now Up, then down is imminent in next hours
really centralized, it's going down
This has become a place to advertise junk projects and scams
WARNING! BNB high risk, soft rug moment. sell and don't buy again.
18898 is next good support. If it breaks, it may further fall to 17 (short!). Otherwise we a pretty low already. Slowly fill u're bags with every dip.
a thought for investors who entered 2022.  It's gonna fall to 10-12K.
bearish will come down to 19k-17k 
Buy next waterfall to 10k starting at 15k just in case we don脌 get to 10k
Crash incomming ! Remmember 5 april 2022 and 6 juin 2022. And now 19 august 2022. The crypto market will fall cause its just maintained by scammer !
Crypto winter 
fat years are over
guys you wont see any pump in this years or in the next years , next pump will in 2024
hello everyone BTC very soon fall to bottom it is just swinging before fall so my advice to all day trades be careful and sold out all your bitcoins 
here is the beauty, it䏭 likelihood to go down even more because Mt Gox investors are going to flood the market with BTC right after waiting for years so yea go buy the dip and you will pour your money into others pocket. 
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven, when I awoke I spent that on a bitcoin. 
I still couldn脌 believe my eyes there are people ask others to buy the dip. for f sake, the price is going down now so if you buy you are most@likely to end up negative right? so why buy the DIP? Evil idiot! 
i'm close market... and big dump is coming
is going to drop a lot before this year runs out 
It is officially over for 
It's going down folks, absolutely  nothing good is going on !  Nothing ! 𣸮 𣸮 𣸮  No godd news is bear news !
its going down to 15k wake up people. 
John is one of the best investors I've ever know this year. I think she should be given such an award.
Just look at our huge gains! Look at them!! Let's see your big smile!!!
long ways to go yet, grab your popcorn and enjoy the show
shorts free money
take a short break moonboys. It's half-time break now. Time to re-think your "strategies"
the FED is going to hike up the rates and already provided hint to counter inflation. massive sell off end of this week to next week. if it happens we could see another few k drop. get ready for some amazing payout from the moon hodlers. 
The low bitcoin price, rising electricity prices and high inflation are forcing mining companies to get rid of their bitcoins
There's plenty upcoming world event that gonna effect bitcoin price  The fed next meeting $ETH   Marge ISO 20022 World Cup   this is gonna be bearish season boyss !!
This manipulation will eventually end. 
Told yall we would crash again.  :)
Universal decentralized forever
Waiting, it needs a few more big red dildos until we see 12K
Weekend pump and dump starting a bit late due to all the moonboys getting REKT on Friday. 22K then dump again..people never learn the whales have you all by the balls.
You All Guys Wrong This 8 Year Bear Market Continuing So Short Trade Is Best In This Bear Market Crypto Rekt Your Money So Don't Invest In Altcoins Only BTC Is Better For Long Term Best Of Luck 
after Elon Musk went on SNL and torpedoed this coin I will never spend another dime on it
poor code contributions to the repos, no extra value added, this coin will fall
We need to see another massive correction before can expect another bullshit pattern! 
after the hack ppl lost trust in this
Guys be real we all saw the crash comming D:
has failed to be adopted. The account model it uses didn't let it moon
I'm keep buying it, the more it dropes the more I will buy.
things have been tough after the hack, I don't think polkadot will recover
1.5 million ETH sent to Binance. Preparing a sell off ? 
another day not to buy eth
best time to sell you can buy again at 800 to 1000 usdt after few days
BTC trash ponzi scheme Hope Michael Saylor Goes Bankrupt and all the whales too ! this trash deserves to be at 10k and then pump ! extremely over rated trash that has no real world use ! $ETH will surpass this trash in the future !
BYE BYE ETH CRASH 
Cardano vasil update is 33% activated, it needs to reach 75% of nodes to be considered live. Say goodbye to your chain in 6 months
concerned about the merge having censorship and centralized built in when merge occurs 
Crypto 100 percent centralized as it crumbles under every notice from the government.
damn what a blood bath
damn you ready to fall?  huge one is coming
down down down down down down down down down rubbish just go down
Eth is going down it will little up and then it will go under 1000 usd and It's fake pump.. just for grab your money.. don't be fool just wait and buy under 1000 at original price.
Ethereum is a scam coin, good luck waiting for the broken merge
everything above 1$ is overpriced.
forgot the merge won't fix gas fees. ouch. 
going to zero    scam scam 
Guys be real we all saw the crash comming D:
I cant trust market right now. Sold my 3 ETH and I will wait for next dump.. DYOR
I just knew its going down XD but no one believed me and my comment was even removed XD. gonna go around 900
I shorted  $ETH at the bottom 
I think this is a fake pump
I will invest 4million on it , if it goes 1187,91.
is bsolutely dependent on Bitcoin. IOTA is much the better solution.
is goin down, down, down, haha :) Its actually a good thing tho. Dont worry, it'll go back up. It'll eventually go to freakin moons, but until then it'll just go up to the sky. AND it'll do this real soon. Eth will rise high here real soon. Till then(prob couple weeks)it'll do its reg stuff- up/down up/down up/down till gets closer to the merge in Sep.(i think Sep is latest estimate?) So all i'm just sayin in all seriousness is this-Shortly after merge, or just before while leading up to merge, Eth will shoot to the skys! But AFTER merge tho, Eth will blow right past ALL skies and fly atw up to the moons! BABEE! Up to the glorious heavens! And then, ONLY THEN, you can sell! Until then, NO SELLING UR ETH! If anything, buy, buy, buy. I mean even if it dont get atw to heavens, Eth will ALWAYS be worth a LOT after the merge. U WONT lose with Eth! Hang tight, wait, dca & hodl, hodl, HODL! my fortunate peeps as there wont EVER be this opportunity again! Not in our lifetime, my peeps!
is it kind of scam ???
It is really sad to see that most people imagine that merge will change the value of ethereum. The only true cryptocurrency is only Bitcoin. Expect a massive crash starting 9/19/2022
Just fake pump and liquidity grabbing 
keep calm and relax. 
keep holding until it breaks 1795 and down position it is
literally the worst, only idiots have this
lol to ETH, will go down even further. 
Merge is not big deal whales pumping and just to grab liquidity soon below 1000 usd
No fud just truth. Bruh just wait until the merge. Shorting ETH will be the best move. since a buy the rumor and sell the news. what happens when matic hits 2$ again. Gas fees will be high. what happens when ETH chain gets so congested. fees will be high. merge is the worst 
no.  Stick to Bitcoin
On 16 of August I told you guys that the weekly was ready to fall of a cliff.  Well now am telling you that the montly is ready to fall of a cliff...
On the road to centralized crypto
Once the Merge is release you will see $ETH price just drop and it is all to do with human emotion. People buy when the news is out and when the merge happens people will revise the priced didn't put and sell. Don't get me wrong $ETH massive potential in the future.
overvalued, high fee, incompetent dev
remember what I said about being bearish? called it bros
scam coin going to zero in 2 days mark my words
sell its going down from here im trying to save you
selling all my ETH. 
so bad but wait
The break down is here. GET IN TO CASH NOW
the goc ban ethereum
They will dump it back to 1k
this is about to get much worse before it gets better
this was a fake pump, after speaking with wall street it Is set to believe a new conspiracy is on the merge with our universe and the multiverse. Believe no one. the truth is in plain sight 
time to good bye, thank you be a big part in crypto. 'The Merge' is the biggers mistake u have done. 
too much gas fee
Vatalik Buterin "JP Morgan helped me create an unregistered security. Then we took 70% for ourselves before offering it to the market" Like i Said ETH is a censorship and centralized protocol. 
wait you can buy Eth at 800 to 1000 usd after some days
well done killing off the GPU mining community...
will be declared a security after the merge
Will below 1000 According  to Technical analysis 
will crash after "the merge"(which doesn't solve any of eth problems btw). Stick to ada
will dissapear between 2023 and 2024
will dump again soon
Will go down then buy it
yall seen the ETH devs making fun of ETH staking. yeah I would short then maybe buy after the merge. 
you better start taking me seriously.. all you eth2 hype boys just learned what happens when you mess with CMCs largest whale. I'll liquidate you to oblivion until you stop the disrespectful behavior towards ME. .. aka the biggest crypto whale in the world 
a very big drop follows. of about 80%. until December we will see LUNC at 0.0000178. my advice is not to buy yet.
Don't let anyone fool yourselves, there is no chance of this coin rising again. This is seen as a scam, please don't get delusional and don't get your hopes up.
I believe till things calm down and a solid plan and market is strong this will rise and drop slowly 
no one can save lunc嵰嵰
scam, run boys run
this lunc done kill me嵰
To much Risk
account based coin, multiple hacks, constant downtime, untested bridges..what's not to like?
Alert trapping now ready to dump. stand by,  $15 soon
check the technical aspects of this chain, it has no chance of surviving. I want retail not to lose money, you will be victims of venture capitals taking profit once this pumps and reaches their desired price
Garbage Solana will fall soon
going down. Network fails every time,  look at the facts! Head and Shoulder will give us a nice short opportunity.
Guys be real we all saw the crash comming D:
hope this new entity working on the open scource net will improve this
I think it will dump big time 
if you care for your future financial situation please sell Solana, it's really easy to see it already failed
I'm losing hope for this coin.
i'm not a fan of solana at all!
is done, unreliable and hackable chain. No real value at all. It uses the account model as well instead of uxto. Not suitable for a blockchain.
It will go down day by day, the code is pretty bad and some software design decisions they made are built up into the core. That's not something you can refactor at this point. This project has failed and it's not scalable. When will it collapse? depends on how fast user amount grows. If Sol reaches active millions users in a couple of months you will see the end of Solana quicker than expected
just so i have a little bit exposure
Market is down today
not time to buy. Waiting till bear is full
only payed 2000 but will sell in a few years to get some cash back offc
projects leaving the Solana eco system and entering $MATIC .  Better tech. More robust and doesn¡¦t break down  every 2 weeks.  Sell your $SOL  now! And don¡¦t buy that bubkis watch!
scam!!! Lose all your money
shitcoin ready to implode, sell it all
short unstill it uptrend hit to $15
SOL will not rise for some days.
solna getting down Becuase solna breakout his support next support on 25 doller
The catch? It was all fake. Every single dollar was counted SEVERAL times over.
There is no buying in these stuff from now on. It was and always been a scam from start, Just to lure buyres and rip them off like ponzi scheme. Every Crypto is and always been of cost $0. Everything till now was just a bulls trap for loosers to buy in. Protect whatever you are left with and run from this PONZI.
This month, 2 Solana developer brothers admitted to pretending to be 11 different devs, who jointly created Dapps that accounted for $7.5bn in value. 
totally shitcoin coin dump hard more likely.. peoples start dump now
toxic for the space. Unreliable uptime. Hacks. It needs to go
we are taking these crooks to court. the Blockchain outages violate US code 13678 along with 135667 and the US Constitution. Solana soon will go to 0, and the devs know it! 
Low grade stablecoin. Sun token nonsense. Good projects leaving the chain. Been hodling years now, should have known better.
Low value stablecoin, always will be.
after sec trial xrp whales will sell it all
after the sec the creators, which have 95% of the tokens will sell it all and leave all the xrp peasants holding a big bag of nothingness
CEO owns 95% of the coins. He will sell at a profit after sec trial and will f_ck all retail investors
Don't listen to the xrp YouTube whales.  They bought to high and now want their money back by letting you invest.
i hate you ripple labs. so i buy more #xrp because i am an idiot. 
is inflationary so much supply there will be more xrp in the market and it will drop more
