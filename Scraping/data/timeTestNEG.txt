ALL these worthless "Upgrades" and a "Hardfork" are just smoke and mirrors to hide a TERRIBLE Coin that's down -80% in ONE YEAR!!!  Go with BTC & ETH and stop being an ADA cheapskate...
cardano github node has 500 issue and filter by bugs and you will find they have 210 bugs and some of them are open and not fixed since 2020.
cardano is so heavy to go up. its like theres an achor stuck on the ground
Get out after Hardfork pump. Take profits, as this Coin will go down to .30 by Q2, 2023.
ghost chain, soon not worth anything.
Going into the shitter faster than a mexican at a bbq
have been borrowing ada on bnb and selling them since 1 dollar
is never going to be worth much. Not a bad project problem is there is 34 billion coins with a max of 45 billion. Burn about 44 billion and I would consider buying some.
it will fall like all
Its time for ADA to xplode ��𤣳��𤨎
L1 narrative is dead. ETH has upgraded. The future is in Ethereum now.  All problems Ethereum has before have been eliminated. No need to develop on shit unsecure chain like this when Ethereum is good now. Sell while you can other L1s will slowly die.
LOL. Moons and rocket�䏭 now till the feds raise interest rates on September 21. Vasil upgrade on September 22? Ouch. That is some really bad decision making. 
never buy again this trash
the newest meme coin. ADA is in for failure. Focused and invested to much time and money in Africa. 
very disappointing coin.. been listening to hype around this coin for far to long.. not convinced buy Monero 
9$ incoming. Giant head and shoulders. Blood in the streets for a rocky project that has dirty influence in the crypto space.
Bearish due to wider market negative sentiment
get out before its too late  buy hbar or algo.
going down like luna 
going to drip to bottom of the earth
Has to attack superior tech to keep them down. The superior tech will win no matter what. AVAX is a shitcoin.
sell this shitcoin
something seems a little off with avax
The Videos are very likely real.  His statement against it was also vey weak.  Everything just fits too well together.  Its really sad to see and i also liked AVAX before that.  But this..... well i don't want to be involved into such a criminal project.  And as long as there are no real proofs that the videos are fake, i will keep my attitude.
This token goes down like my poo in the toilet in the morning.  I sold everything I still had 6344
ada is gonna destroy centralized bnb
Binance is a fraud because it is one of the biggest holders of Luna Classic. With a 200% pump, it was able to attract a lot of capital to itself.. Now you see the fall.  This is a game for adults
bnb bearish go $20k soon ..I..
is lost in time !
pump & dump token
15 sept crash
18k at soon, I hope it doesn�脌 go down 
2. miners will start sell they btc, to covers operating cost.
20K turned from support into resistance. August Jobs Report came back positive and bulls can't even get $BTC   to stay above 20K for more than 10 minutes YET these MoonBoyz have the nerve to get on here and say 30K soon!!!!! �鴂� Macro economic conditions are ominous. DXY is flirting with $110. Europe won't have enough gas to get through Crypto Winter. China's economy is about to crash and burn. China will then FULL SCALE invade Taiwan. DXY will shoot to $115 very soon. 10K $BTC   INCOMING. It's BEAR season.
3. People will panic once btc move below $17,000
A word of advice! Brace yourselves.. ��䔝
all fed bs aside the head over shoulders is 9k for BTC. you can definitely expect it to hit 11-13k this is not the bottom 
All markets crashing. Expect the same for BTC.
at least at least at least $13K BTC. There is very weak support at 20K. But $13k has strong support. So I would buy at 13k but not at 20k, which has not been tested, so it VERY VERY weak there. Patience. Wait for Dec.
Bearish as the moment with the view on a very bullish future
bearish on btc. Lots of room to move downwards. we are still so many months away from a bull cycle. 
Bitcoin must collect liquidity from the bottom before going to the pump! So expect a sharp dump this week! ����
BTC $850 doller down now dumping this price 
BTC dont have any support level right now. It didn't get a bigger volume. May be it should touch 19K today. Stay tuned. 
BTC price prediction is not more than 25K$ 
btc will start to go down slowly to maybe to 12,000 region , before pumping back up slowly, 
Bull trap next week
careful, big dump soon
Crash!!�� just die bitcoin!..
ETH & $BTC  play poker, see the true face soon.
Extereme fear price will plummet to 17k - 18k range only reason price would go up now is market manipulation by some big company be wise and patient good days will come
fake pump
Falling like a rock but can immediately bounce back like a ball
GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL HAVE THE SHIRT ON YOUR BACK ! 
going to 11k or even lower over next few months�� if you think otherwise you�胩e being decisive �� screen shot this
haha, bearish on Bitcoin. I agree with the rest, the price will go lower. 
Ho do you feel about Bitcoin? obviously bull trap. Short from that level. There is no good news around. 
It�䏭 wild how everyone in crypto has the same goal yet hates each other. lmao. You say something bad about btc and bulls rush ya something good and the bears come. 
just hanging out at 20k, no breakout foreseeable 
lets buy the deep!!!
lol bull babies do not like my stated facts because they don�脌 believe facts. Continue crying, there will be more tears come Sunday. No more milk for you. Drink water instead. 
looking for 7-9K bottom.  Riding the BITI short all the way down.  
more fall is about to come before halving 
MT GOX INCOMING, MY PREDICTION BITCOIN DOWN IN 15K - 16K
next big stock drop btc will go to 17k
not looking good.
Not one coin moves unless bitcoin moves. Make it make sense. 
ok guys its gonna dump for $18k then pump later!!
PLATO $MARK STAY AWAY FROM THIS TOKEN. BULL IS A CHANCE FOR THEM TO EXIT AND CASH OUT. THIS IS MANIPULATED TOKEN ON CEXS. HUOBI BITMART KUCOIN GATEIO ... helps them by listing this token. think! just some cexs list the token. do u think it won't be manipulated????? $BTC  $ETH  
pumping, I am bearish, matter of few days we will see new low
So that's it. BTC  is done , no power no stupid people to invest in . All crypto world are watching and buying LUNC . 
Still bearish, as recession coming in Europe and USA, the cinese situation and the war in Ukraine will bring the economy much more down. we haven�脌 seen the bottom still so wait for it this winter. Still think we are going to 11/14k 
there is no pump. The volume has not increased. 
this is about cycles. We must go down to go up again with all strength and break ATH.
time to die...
we are not far away from Sunday. vol is usually half of what it is now. what effect that would have on the price? Go to bed and come back the next morning, you will ask yourself what just happened. 18k on the cards then 17k then a free fall. 
When bitcoin hits 1 dollar im buying 10. Come at me Bulls. �鴂� 
will hurt moonboys on its way down to 10k.
Coin will be make new high as soon as.
invest in anything other then a shitcoin..
some new gem will come but not 
could never recover after the big hack they suffered. People should be wiser when investing
i really love the astheitc of this token its beautiful i jjust wish there was a reason to invest in it
scam going to zero
soon out of the top 10. Dot could never recover from the big hack it suffered
this coin has been rejected by the community after the big hacks it suffered. Out of top 20 soon
when people where thinking of 100$ DOT it will definately go to 0.1 cent its the game. invest more=market burns it more I withdraw all when it was 22
will be killed by nervos network in the field of interoperability

all whales who's support proof of work  have'' eth ''so they should sell them after the merge and the market will down
book profit and sell now selling this crypto 
definitely bearish as it is too overpriced. I would not recommend investing your all money to ETH. It is also weird that the price doubled itself in the bear market while there is no any significant reason. And last but not least, do invest in $ADA for long term returns :)
Down to 100 USD in quarter of a year after merge, mark my words...
dump dupm dumping dump dupm dumping

Great opportunity to short once again.
i do not think it gouing to moon , price will change litbit but soon it will bearish 
If there is a POS, then the trust in eth will fall. Why ? 1 Will lose decentralization 2 AMD, NVIDIA and Miners have invested a lot of money without them, the price will definitely fall.
if you think the mErGe will send ETH to the moon, you are delusional. Dump now or be dumped on by fat-pocketed VCs.
is biggest scam in history vitalik is a criminal Makes Promo with merge Green energie and ripped peoples money!!!
is garbage sold everything vitalik is a scammer he make promo with merge and stole all money with Little Pump and Big dump he is a criminal he stole money from right people they work Hard every day and have spend in eth and lost everything because they trust them he is a Bad
it・s going to $1100 you heard it here first 
it's going dowwnnnnn :( glad I jumped ship at the first peak
just stop my little bro. I'm on your side. its okay that you bought eth at 4k it happens. eth will have a run up just not this year. every coin will have a run just depends on tech. be a smart trader and stop making yourself look like a little fool. 
Like BTC moonboys, everyone is FOMOing into the merge news that was priced in months ago. ETH will dump soon after but moonboys keep piling in and get REKT time and time again. Its like watching a woman get beat by her abusive BF and go back to him after he says he is sorry and he has changed. Its total BS, but she goes back anyway and gets another beating.
like i said in July. it's a bull trap $BTC $XRP $ETH 
lmaooooo if you are smart take gains. if your a moon boi with a steemy check takes gains. 
maxipads always need to lie just pump they heavy useless bags.
maxipads right now they need retail fomo before the merge. 
merg wil go bad 
merge will be a flop nothing is going to happen. miners are packing up and picking other POW chains. ETH was only popular bc of miners nothing more. layer 2 will build a bridge too other layer 1s and ditch ETH. eth maxipads "must protect my bags and need to lie too the ppl"
my little brother (incogneto) is providing you false info about ETH staking. Lido only gives you 3% apy also its locked up!!! the only way to collect awards/unstake is when other upgrade happens and that's not until 6 too 12 months. 
Never buy eth again ist scam for whales loser Coin better Look other Coin! vitalik is loser!! daemon!!!
new support target down now 1550 doller please support it selling this crypto 
No changing in gas few after the Merge!!!! disguting
order books dont lie. Too many ETH long positions..
PoW is the reason BTC cannot enter mass adoption. It's so primitive that even Visa & Mastercard better than it. Stakeholders wanted to implement a lightning network layer to improve Bitcoin's performance and scalability but $ETH offers much promise.
Probably gonna dip below the dip from July. Around 800 ish in Oktober - November. Beginning of 2023 the rise will start again.
staking is not liquid staking bc it's locked up for 12 months. lido staking pool can only give you 3.9 staking awards and won't be able to collect until other upgrade. nothing in the white paper say it will give you 8% staking awards that's total false. 
the "flippin" won't happen anytime soon or even after the merge. eth maxipads need to lie always just make a quick buck. 
The calm before the storm. The pump before the big dip. Eth whales are about to hunt FOMOers. Dont get trapped. Im out until ETH go down hard again
The market manipulation is real out here ;(
the merge will be the last pump, we respect eth for being a 2nd generation and the creator of defi,  but it has no chance against a 3rd generation coin like Cardano
the whole market still trending down. dca in
They won't let me out, I got locked up. 
today "active" address count. you have a lying stvpid ape in the comment section.
very down price profection new support is 1550 doller now this vol very low 
where are the merge nerds at now lol
will bearish by end of today 
will dump hard after merge
will go down to 900 before merge
Won't be able to unstake 6to12 months, won't collect award until upgrade. Lido only gives you 3.9 staking awards ETH will lose its decentralized form and will be a centralized/censorship chain when the merge happens Gas fees won't be fixed and scaling will be a problem. 
wowow up because sometimes this crypto down now selling this crypto sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell se
0.00032 now looks good but in the long run I think it will drop again
Are you ready for a big dump? ��� SELL NOW 
big Scam sell nor before it's too late. they steal our money big red Flag
big Scam they steal our money and dump on us
can somone answer and make clean situation in binance about Lunc/Busd after 7 September? I am on binance and shoud I stay on binance with mu Lunc/Busd afer this date, will I loose my lunc, or shoud I move somewhere else?
death cross on 1 hr timeframe btw. Moon boys don't like me cause i'm realistic. I look at facts and data and not hopium. Daily rsi is still at 72. A big correction to 0.00013 before next leg up
down hard dude
going to hell, 0.00025 again...
It wants to dump sooo bad
its Just Manipulation, carefull of rugpull
Officially Breakdown the trendline. carefull of fake pump.
party will end soon
people still fall for it again eve after Luna debacle in May.
So many people here will lose all their monies.
This coin is a time bomb in the short term, the pin is already out with the binance annoucement yesterday. How can this coin stand on the top 20 in market cap with holders that wanna quick profit
volume is drying up. The uptrend is over, it doesn't have the strenght to make higher highs. Below the 20s within 4 days mark my words
what did i tell u lol. The volume is decreasing everyday. That means that the pump was only fomo and now that the hype is gone it will dump everyday
When the time comes, they will ask you, what coin were you holding in bull market? BTC rising, this shit is dumping, Lol.
definitely feeling bearish on Solano. more bullish on XRP
Im waiting for sol to wakeup. Im bearish but I loaded up more sol right now. I hope I made a good decission.
is focused on making a phone and a physical store instead of fixing all the problems and bugs that SOL has.
Just F $SOL  and it's terrible blockchain.
massive long term head and shoulders good night for a few years
this project is kinda disappointing.
this project is kinda disappointing.
to 3$.   going to be replaced by $aptos next bull run anyway.  solana's USP's of low fees and quick tx is now disappeared into dust.   no good dapps on solana either lmao.  easily a 0.5 bil project or less
Someone has the keys to the treasury so it is not decentralized
TRX.. Please wake up!
with USDD growing Justin can dump his $TRX 
i lost all my fucking money on this dog shit coin, you will suffer.
selling everything I own directly or indirectly until the depression is over!
this coin is so over hyped 
This garbage is severely overvalued and it�䏭 investors are the most brainwashed moonboys in all of finances
xrp is the worst shitcoin besides $STRNGR 
ABSOLUTELY THE WORST STABLECOIN
After Vasil it will dump to a quarter, and after Voltaire I guess they'll be finished developing garbage code that does nothing so it will hit $0.00 then. DOGE will have so much more utility than this complete waste of time network that is totally useless. I can't believe anyone thinks this adds any value to the world.
Back under .50 you go,  trash coin!
ETH $ADA will replace this patethic network, goodbye ether
No one cares about this trash! Just make the ADA price high so we can dump this garbage! Worst project ever made by the most disgusting, selfish and greedy losers in the world! Truly horrible people!!!
No support for the Vasil upgrade. If you don脌 believe me, time will tell. You will get so sick from your losses. Look at the top 10 coins and all the projects and deals that are going on. ADA out of top 10 by the end of the year. 
Out of top 10 this year 
Project for 5 years prospects. There will be no rapid growth and do not wait.
shit, big shit like xrp
So many of you will be disappointed on September 22. Can脌 wait to read the comments 
Sorry about your luck 鴂
avax hack destroyed the trust ppl had on this blockchain. Cardano is the only layer 1 that is worth it in technical terms
it will drop in a few days 
seems berish in some hours
pump & dump token
: the price is very slowly increasing But if this continues, is an unkown. At the end of the september, the FED and the ECB are going to increase de rates. The cost of living will then rise. QT in america and Europe will olso have and effect on the price of assets, but more for the financial risky assets. In order to safely invest in crypto, you need money you can loose, with fear. And the investmentgroups are becoming smaller. The interest in bonds will increase, because it is a 'saver' asset. For the time being i am bearish.
18700 coming I think  18700 is bottom
A fraudulent project! Sell it! Urgently!
attempt to fall can脌 you see  The bulls shall hurt soon. 
Bahahahaaaaa ! I knew this would happen to Bitcoin !  Bahahaha !
Bear flag broken, perfect retest to 21.7k, before the plunge down at next 100 points FED rate hike. Epic play !
buy lunc fr better gains rather thn btc 
cpi index smashing us hard today
crash is due to the fed raising the rate again by 3%. 
If it's reversal to the upside, it's wouldn't be so obvious. You see whales did a BIG pump last few days ago, they know it's going to make many think BOTTOM IS IN !! And that's when they start distributing more to retailers. BTC by Dec to Q2, 8k to 12k range. Bear macro too great. Inflation too high still. If real reversal, it wouldn't be so obvious. Imagine they distributing now in anticipation of 100points hike on 22 Sep, that would be epic crash 
Im out and waiting for late next week to buy back.
In all past cycles, BTC has always corrected MINIMUM 80% and maximum 90% from ATH. 
in the first when i seen this green candle i knew that only pumbs
In this worse than expected in this bearish macro environment, it's VERY VERY possible at least 10k to 13k. And all alts bleed worse. Do not fomo in crypto or you will be REKT VERY badly. Crypto will take 1-2 years to recover. Be patient. Wait for Dec to Q1 Q2.
Investing in Bitcoin can be more profitable when you have the right tools -a risk management broker, an expert mentor/manager. Either Bearish or Bullish you胩e never in loss.
it will dump from here now 
Just wait until winter and let䏭 see if the EU chooses btc over heat and fuel. Putin is getting his btc on the low low tho. 
just whales playing with the price, new botton coming until the end of october , then the bull market starts .
macro has NOT changed. no blow off the top until Russia says the war is over. 
MtGOX this week, 10k here we come
My target is 17,500 $BTC  Dump the fake pump. Do not buy this little hype before another correction.
panic selling 
prepare for a short this evening/tomorrow morning Nigerian time
SELL AND GO SHORT NOW , 2023/24 super bullish 
sell now or cry later,, 100% scam
Sell or you will cry later dont giver your funds for pumber
take your profits now before whales take it from you
there it is... and this time it'll go down hard. you know what to do, don't you? $USDC ... just saying. stop your losses. 
there won't be a bull run until inflation is much lower and rates are being cut.
They drive the price up with hype and positive news knowing btc price is going to drop when FED hike the interest rate. Don脌 be fool. 
This drop is just getting started, wait until the FOMC meeting..you think rigth now is bad wait until Powell starts talking after inflation came in hot again.
today midnight 19000 tirgate
who could have ever seen this dump coming? Short term bear
will end bad
瞿12,000.00 will be the Christmas  early January bottom. 
$SHIBA $BabyDoge Looks like all these 3 coins it's just a manipulation nothing more... You don't think so?
slowly leaving top 10, people lost interest
:))) decentralization my arse! just another playground for speculators and scammers like buterin, changpeng, kwon etc just look who is selling and buying right now :)

ada will kill it soon, it's way ahead
after marge u see big dumped 
be greedy when others are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy. 
Bearish for today, however overall bullish until the merge. I think we will see a big sell off mid-end of september as the bull run levels out and people reap their profits, however those who HODL will come out on top in the years to come.
big damp comin up in 3 days
biggest pump buying selling now 
biggest scam pos. Does not and will not give you 8% staking awards like ETH maxipads are claiming. Also it's not liqwid staking bc it's locked up.

I don’t know if anyone else can tell what the charts are saying…. Bottom is Gonna be Extremely ROUGH!!!!!
I got liquidated at 1695, what does that tell you about manipulation
I swear ETH maxipads need to lie. Scam ETH maxipads will lie to make thier protocol look good. some say we have more devs working on ETH well duh EVM is easy and easy to hack and other thing ETH was one of the first to be in the crypto scene. if it was made now it wouldn't be popular. it would be a shitcoin. 
I think Ethereum is destined to hit sub 1k after this merge. That right there would be an opportunity of a lifetime.
I'll start buying in heavy after the ucoming crash.
It is only hype. Don’t get trap. We are still in a bear market and months away from a bull cycle. See Eth to be below 1k once the sell off begins. 
just short it before merge , sell till you have time 
keep dumping please another 100-200
lmao BTC us pumping while ETH is down. a sign of a dump coming soon. 
lol it's dipping more than BTC get ready for exchanges too buy the dip so losers will support this broken chain

merge flop merge flop merge flop !!! sell this worstless "coins" it's going to be a security then sec will blame crypto for being a scam. merge flop!!! lmaooo dumb monkeys going to get rugged soon. bahahaha !!!
merge will be a flop nothing is going to happen. miners are packing up and picking other POW chains. ETH was only popular bc of miners nothing more. layer 2 will build a bridge too other layer 1s and ditch ETH.
merge will flop. stETH whatever ETH will be a security in the future then big dump on retail bc they are locked in lmaooo just wait for the dumping. 
new lower lows are incoming!
No one cares about the merge anymore. They only care because they are ready to dump hard when idiots FOMO in. Its going to be an epic disaster...
one if the worst POS chains in the game. why would anyone lock up 35 eth for 12 months. that's just crazy. I only see people doing this are the VCs and centralized exchanges. nothing will be fixed gas fees will be a problem, it's going to be centralized and censorship. AKA shit coin.
Over priced global Elite agenda token. Let's take away POW so we can move to POS so the rich can only get richer. The problem with POS is it's a piece of shit, by making staking rewards more abundant for the rich. With POW at least we had a fighting chance. It was never about conserving energy and anyone who says otherwise has no clue what's really going on. There is no lack of energy in this world, only an abundance of rich and greedy people who tell lies to benifit themselves by minipulation common men. God will reward you handsomely in hellfire.
proof of Sh*t merge will be a complete failure. will dump hard. secure your profits now.
put a fork in her, she's done
Sell while you can.

shit going down. stupid people still hope. all crypto is sbout to collapse in close future.
stack for the future
staking is a trojan horse for etherium
staking is not liquid staking bc it's locked up for 12 months lmaoo what is this a bank ?
the biggest shiity POS will be ETH and a rug will happen.
This coin is awful as transaction requires LOTS of gas fee. What's the point of using a crypto when its fee is ten times higher than a bank?
this is gonna sell off insanely after the merge.
tomorrow india market Closed ETH price down now just midnight 
Very bullish until the day before the merge. Bearish after. I will be selling 60% of my coins right before.   Not sure if good idea or not but will make a profit either way
We are going more down after some correction almost 1250 must and possibly in case of errors we will come below 1000. 
whales always win, don't be idiots and hold thinking is a bull run, we far away from a bull run.. sell and make a quick profit then buy again when it drops.. it's becoming predictable already! 
When it comes to successfully fighting #inflation there is a 0% chance the #Fed will do too much. But there is a 100% chance it's rate hikes will make the current #recession much worse and create a financial crisis, which risks turning the inflation problem into.
will be a dead project after the merge. only 4% staking and 12 month lock up. ETH will the biggest rug. 
will be destroyed by ada
Won't be able to unstake 6to12 months, won't collect award until upgrade. Lido only gives you 3.9 staking awards ETH will lose its decentralized form and will be a centralized/censorship chain when the merge happens Gas fees won't be fixed and scaling will be a problem.
