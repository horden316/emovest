will go down to $3
m mtgox creditor. they didn't contact me
It's obvious that we have excessively consumed the Merge. I still stick to the opinions I made on several posts before, we can begin to do DCA below 1800, I think we may confirm the bottom again at around 1000, so don't buy at a very small gap, we can buy every 200-300 dollars.
it is the next luna.
is old we have a new ecosystem and network that have smaller comission #CUBE  #CMP  and the best #REI  networ,small gas for transaction,need to invest on them
I feel sorry for all the people that are still holding ADA. 
if SOL going down beyond dogecoin, 5 billions to go, well thats embarrasing but not so surprising for such a broken network
Bullish for development, bearish for the price.
calm down
Sell now and buy next month at -30% 
SoLUNA with a lot of network issues and shutdown lol
enjoy the bull trap my boys
The catch? It was all fake. Every single dollar was counted SEVERAL times over.
Will go back and correlate at 35 unless whales comes
It's Luna all over again
fake pumping starting now but selling now selling 
I will invest 4million on it , if it goes 1187,91.
Just HOLD guys, it's a bear market, don't be a foolish investor and sell every thing you own
get in and load up for POLS continue rocket beyond $5  hurry as this bull run will need all the volume we can put in much love
SOL has a big hacking problem right now, seems like the ecosystem has flaws which allowed some private keys to be stolen. Wallets drained as we speak, as we know wallet addresses are public keys and if you have the private keys you can drain them out. A cache of PK was discovered and keys stollen. I saw on twitter a lot of people moving to #Internet  Computer which will integrate Bitcoin in September.
TC $ETH $BNB $SOL $DOGE Like if you got liquidate when cpi report annonceed
this is where it goes off the cliff
Btw, just personal advice!
due to the world problem matric we go down to 1050
will dump to 18k this weekend
Market sentiment looking like we stopped aiming for the moon and hopped on a passing comet instead.
in my opinion we won،¦t see anything exciting until the next Bitcoin halving, although for once I would love to be proven wrong. 
all whales who's support proof of work  have'' eth ''so they should sell them after the merge and the market will down
fake pump again and again and again 
is dead .. $HBAR  will be #1
$13000 here we come, brace yourselfs .. 24 - 26 - 28 July at the very latest ..
stack for the future
going to fall down in few minutes 
Going down, just like that counselor made you do at camp that time.
This month, 2 Solana developer brothers admitted to pretending to be 11 different devs, who jointly created Dapps that accounted for $7.5bn in value. 
BTC  Bank runs have begun in China, depression has not yet been announced, and governments being overthrown worldwide. Expect more pain before the elites finally "reset" the global financial system. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $BNB  $DOT  $DOGE  $XLM  $XDC
I wait until it checks bottom again to buy more.
there won't be a bull run until inflation is much lower and rates are being cut.
today "active" address count. you have a lying stvpid ape in the comment section.
it happens and will happen simply the enevitable, look at the world situation, but its can also be good oportunity to buy, I think it is better still to wait before buying. GOOD LUCK
Coin will be make new high as soon as.
I mean that is a bad pyt for new players in cr4pto
Working in Pakistan for 2 months real opportunity
This thing is struggling to reach 1 billion market cap,  in comparison to the 41  billion it once saw. I don't know why it's trending nor what ppl are seeing in this.
never listen show men like Elon
it will dip more dont buy now
We gonna see a huge dip today
will dump more..shitcoin no utility
It's a meme coin bro
Bearish as the moment with the view on a very bullish future
SHIB hype driven shitcoin. It will die this crypto winter. There's not enough room for 2 dogs. $DOGE has the position. 
I lose a lot whit this coin
people bought at 2 dollars. DCA all the way down. its now at 0.45 cents.
Degenerates are pushing this Coin. Be aware of bearish reversal.
hope it will recover soon 
Dump and run baby
This is essentially a centralized PoS Ethereum. It suffers from mostly the same problems as Ethereum since it's EVM based. The only diffrence I can see is the fact they traded decentralization for speed. (Like most other "ETH killers") And 42% of the initial supply went to the team, while only 16% went to the public sale. I'll say it: It's a VC pump and dump.
more fall is about to come before halving 
centralized. This is account based, non scalable, I keep warning about this. Solana will not make it. Stick to ada
Your ROI completes in 20 days 
Big discount coming soon on Weds at 2pm ET. Buy on the way down. Thank me later.
Solana is making a smartphone? 300$ this summer! *laughs sarcastically*
when people where thinking of 100$ DOT it will definately go to 0.1 cent its the game. invest more=market burns it more I withdraw all when it was 22
this is zionist coin... huge scam comin up soon!
Cardano is losing active wallets. 
if you even a bot use your danm data
It's Bear Market
Merge is IMO a bad decision for ETH. PoS will always be worse than PoW as it breaks all the speech that has brought crypto to it's stage now that is Decentralization. PoS will enable governments and coorporations to manipute and take over everything easily. PoW For The Win!
here come the china-Taiwan tension watch out 
A this is not the right Luna $LUNC 
fake pump this is a trap if u r buyed in low just sell it now and wait for big dip.
573.00 bearish Big swap and dump for multiple altcoin rallies is about to happen. i've been watching 24/7 for 3 weeks. WARNING...
it's going to drop. don't listen to the shill bots on here. you'll see after this weekend. 
i will sell my 1200 ETH now 
i placed my position short
BIG SELL OFF INCOMING SOON  14K TO 10K WILL BE BOTTOM
I don't intend to sell my cryptocurrency for the next five or 10 years. Given the extreme volatility of crypto investments, HODLing is a good way to avoid panic-selling and focus on the long term.
order books dont lie. Too many ETH long positions..
Economists want to stop the misuse of bitcoin & maximize profits. But there are powers & other interest who only want to stop it.   Paying your taxes with Bitcoin may one day be a reality, the internet of things & the dark net interconnect us with technology.
Dead tech, never reach it's ath again. If they can't get the fork working it's RIP.
I think it's gonna go down but at least $5
still hope will boom soon
shit, big shit like xrp
$ETH  $BNB  $USDT  WHAT I SAID TO YOU? TRIED TO SAVE SOME MOONBOYS, BUT NOT WORTH IT. NOW IS LATE. ECLIPSE PHASE AND MOON IS LOS
- getting bearish on day to day cycle! -_-
sorry kids, bullish sign is gone (short term) we are looking at btc between the ranges of 19k-21k. It䏭 very possible for this to change (FOMC meeting) could go to lows of 16k or upwards to $26k
For the growth of the cryptocurrency market, this waste must be eliminated.
After Vasil it will dump to a quarter, and after Voltaire I guess they'll be finished developing garbage code that does nothing so it will hit $0.00 then. DOGE will have so much more utility than this complete waste of time network that is totally useless. I can't believe anyone thinks this adds any value to the world.
BTC $850 doller down now dumping this price 
price has some reliability to btc
dumped, meaning it will be pumped soon
scam!!! Lose all your money
market kicked me out thank you #btc 
BTC  People will be mad salty when they realize this was a typical bear market rally and we are merely at the midway point of downward movement. Think logically. If the bear market is over, this will be historically the shortest, fastest bear market in history at a time when things have never been worse on the global stage. Limit the liquidity you provide for the manipulators and keep some dry powder on the side. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $SOL  $DOT  $DOGE  $QN
centralized + SEC lawsuit + outage + bad tokenomics + no supply cap  idk why people buy this shitcoin i perfer avax atleast it dosn't have $SOL problems  bearish this project is soluna
LUNA is a dead scam coin that scammed a bunch of useless Luna maxi got rugged bc they thought $LUNA is a "investment" I'm glad they lost everything. they deserve it. now go buy the real projects like $ADA $BTC $ETH $XRP buy these coins and hold and stake. ETH bridge to ADA NFT
every empty space needs to be filled
things have been tough after the hack, I don't think polkadot will recover
"I'll tell you a plan for gaining wealth. Just put aside you need for health. It's better than banking, trade or leases Take a bank note, fold it up & then you will find your money in creases!"
The chart doesnt look right to me, it hasn't since 13th July when it bounced off $1006. I don't call anything 'fake' and the break above $1283 suprised me but yesterdays $1424 resulted from a short squeeze and to me it has all the appearance of big money sniffing for liquidity. It might still push a bit higher but I'll still be holding onto my shorts. (metaphorically and literally...lol ;)
shame on you scammer.
BTC $ETH $XRP feel scammed yet?
cardano github node has 500 issue and filter by bugs and you will find they have 210 bugs and some of them are open and not fixed since 2020.
the next pyramid, pamp and damp 100% like LUNA did
Coin will be make new high as soon as.
If you like $SOL  you may like a index for the ecosystem, check $SOLI  is doing well!
will be destroyed by ada
so what do we do? sell? 
Avoid obscure and tricky projects
hope it goes down so I can buy
wanted to load my bags with SOL this bear market, however painful development on SOL and blockchain outages convinced me not to and to choose better alternatives out there..
Binance is a fraud because it is one of the biggest holders of Luna Classic. With a 200% pump, it was able to attract a lot of capital to itself.. Now you see the fall.  This is a game for adults
So, inflation is at one of the highest rates. benchmark interest rate is up to the skies, poverty everywhere, US is provoking China openly, and there are a lot of desperate and stupid people claiming that BTC value will grow imensly. How stupid can you be to believe this crap, I mean, aside "investing" your yearly holidays' money and stay at home at 40 degrees Celsius in a polluted city, hoping that BTC will reach 100k when it is obvious that there is no more money in the market? Go big, starting mid-September BTC should be right it should be: under 1000$. Then sell your houses, increase your mortgages, redirect your wifes to onlyfans, and claim: bullish!!!
just sold sol for quant
staking is a trojan horse for etherium
and other altcoins will go much lower this month. inflation rates probably 10% and if they show 100 basis points  this will set a recession mood and the sentiment  is  gona make this market to tank after the 13th of July.
Huge Funding for the Flood
definitely feeling bearish on Solano. more bullish on XRP
BB RSI and MACD at 1h on Coinbase look like we might be headed for a bearish turn. Keep an eye on it.
So that's it. BTC  is done , no power no stupid people to invest in . All crypto world are watching and buying LUNC . 
be careful fake pump then hard dump
projects leaving the Solana eco system and entering $MATIC .  Better tech. More robust and doesn¡¦t break down  every 2 weeks.  Sell your $SOL  now! And don¡¦t buy that bubkis watch!
REDLUNA  scam copy 
will solana even last this bear market? Project so so centralized it hurts. They literally have a button that says "reset" and they click it and turn off the blockchain whenever they like. Blockchains are supposed to be never ending... Its a shame because I usee to like this project before they used to turn it off every night.
you better start taking me seriously.. all you eth2 hype boys just learned what happens when you mess with CMCs largest whale. I'll liquidate you to oblivion until you stop the disrespectful behavior towards ME. .. aka the biggest crypto whale in the world 
slowly but surely solunavax will fall out of top 10. I feel like polkadot should be top 10 by now. polkadot hasn't shut off bc they used one of cardano white paper lmaooo man feels good not chasing moon boi coins/tokens/high yeild/staking thru rugg pull exchanges (Voyager). 
today Inflation Numbers in the U.S be aware!!! 
+1000 is not a moon. 2 year bear market
im sorry this koin not strong.鴂鴂鴂鴂鴂
merg wil go bad 
No one cares about the merge anymore. They only care because they are ready to dump hard when idiots FOMO in. Its going to be an epic disaster...
BTC price prediction is not more than 25K$ 
lol to ETH, will go down even further. 
fake pump after a massive dump
Last pump before big dump!
Bearish but anything is possible
if Eth doesnt do somethig about their out of control gas fees this could be the end of them. Bitcoin will eventually come back the Eth is gona dies
Developers making money out of announcements on twitter only to delay again each time they make millions while you poor people buy in to the hype. 
this is about cycles. We must go down to go up again with all strength and break ATH.
buy the dip guys come on 
ponzi scheme still attracts more idiots every day 
Starting to really hate
biggest dump if it cannot hold 1200 for another 2.5 hrs. 
Brace yourselves for the permanent Cryptocurrency blanket ban all over the world. This sh*t got destroyed when institutions like Goldman Sachs etc stepped in.
need to be more decentralizerd ... the constant crashing is because of cenetralized control and ease of attacking the network
Did you see the leaks? Shame is not enough to talk about feelings.
take a short break moonboys. It's half-time break now. Time to re-think your "strategies"
Who would suport this clown deserves what they get.
looks like hard dump
will go down to 800$ easily before to the moon. 
SCAM, WILL CRASH WITH USDD
All those revenge gamblers who buy more and more. (D.C.A.-ing) Getting deeper and deeper into debt. And at some point they break, and will start selling !!! What will be the beginning of a rapid BTC crash.
I Sold so it's bearish
Saya merasa bearish pada $DOGE 
interesting analysis for bottom. 
Investing in Bitcoin can be more profitable when you have the right tools -a risk management broker, an expert mentor/manager. Either Bearish or Bullish you胩e never in loss.
Russia tried to save its wealth by putting it into crypto. They will crush the crypto market to crush Russia. This will drop by at least half. Get out. Buy back later. Much later.
I think the FED is going to raise interest rates .75% on 7/14/2022 , and that we will be in an official recession on 7/28/2022.  This will cause the 2nd wave of sell offs.
PLATO $MARK STAY AWAY FROM THIS TOKEN. BULL IS A CHANCE FOR THEM TO EXIT AND CASH OUT. THIS IS MANIPULATED TOKEN ON CEXS. HUOBI BITMART KUCOIN GATEIO ... helps them by listing this token. think! just some cexs list the token. do u think it won't be manipulated????? $BTC  $ETH  
ETH $SOL $BTC thank you all for this exit liquidity . good luck see you in 22 days 
Compare all top20 coins price last year this day and today, solana is almost the only one that in a year hasn't lost value, in fact it even gained, and a lot This says it all kids.
dot and solana were hacked, you cant trust your money to these noob chains....stick to ada, the only one that has never been hacked
If you look at the 4H chart you could see a bear flag. This is my TA and could be completely wrong, let me know what y'all think!
will be a dead project after the merge. only 4% staking and 12 month lock up. ETH will the biggest rug. 
I،¦m so bullish about sol with co operating brave browser soon 90
I buy BTC in bulk if you wanna sell, at a very good rate. I think we might be dropping to 17K $BTC 
chart weekly on bearish
hodl this while other crypto gains big,  嚜篤ho promised you burns, what do you think luna 2.0 money grew on trees
people are starting to see that ethereum can only grow up to a certain numbers of users before collapsing in fees and in overload due to the account model and the fact that it couldn't solve the trilemma. It had the hash power and for nonsensical reasons it switched to proof of stake, now it cannot compete with ada at all
borrowing 10 Bitcoin at 21k from Infinite Freedom Foundations at 1% per day fee!
BTC $ETH $XRP garbage, buy it if you support the WEF!
corrupt. bag holders delusional trying to hold on lmao. dont be biased when it comes to finance
its going down again. too many dumps
why can't it also be stable as the dollar as a means of payment
big Scam sell nor before it's too late. they steal our money big red Flag
Crypto going down is not a bad thing, 
why eth when u can go hbar.
there is a del coin mined with the help of staking, it has very great prospects
have been borrowing ada on bnb and selling them since 1 dollar
sell now or cry later,, 100% scam
sol is going lower and lower , i will DCA and see what happens 
Charles on Twitter "we're having a tough time upgrading everything, this may not work, but I'm giving you a heads up so when the boat goes down you can't blame me"
Ethereum BIG FAIL! $CSPR is ETH v3.0 created by Ethereum developers! Why wait for ETH v2.0 that is probably never coming!? Casper is the real ETH killer and can easily rise to top 10-20 for 100x! Even $DOT is a better project than ETH right now!
We gotta go deeper now... It's not time yet
game over , next bull run after 6 years 
I think Bitcoin will fall to 27000 and then to 17000
It's a pump trap
Ethereum developers etc made their money from this news announcement and will leave everyone in the dust only to delay again literally making money out of Twitter posts.
who could have ever seen this dump coming? Short term bear
Big pump was good, but in the next weeks we will have a big dump
BTC  Solana is in its deepest sleep, by the time it wakes up, it's going to roar, that time is close. 
enough hacks to make it crash
BTC  $ETH  $DOT  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE   Tesla(Elon) dumped 75% of his BTC worth of 936 million US Dollar. Why you say? Because they know the crash will come sooner or later.
solana has been hacked again, no future for this insecure  and unscalable network
careful, big dump soon
Someone is trying REALLY HARD to keep BTC at 23K..and this is why i know its going to go down and down hard. If you look at the on chain data..there is next to no real activity that shows growth on the network. Transaction volume is way down.. all bearishness aside i think this is going to tank soon right along with the US stock market that is high on crack right now..
LUNA this project can't be revived, deal with it and be save
LUNA this project can't be revived, deal with it and be save
see this all time chart sol iis near to touch all time low sell now
will never go up, wake up guys 
price are hot but currently it's bearish, it's not fair, why investors are not buyiing it?
Davos/IMF pushing for world wide CBDC. BTC will be outlawed.
Eth is going down it will little up and then it will go under 1000 usd and It's fake pump.. just for grab your money.. don't be fool just wait and buy under 1000 at original price.

dump it guys plsss, so we can get a chance too!
why is the network haves continuesly problems? Please solve the issue this is a good project but the network is really bad.
BTC  Still bearish and still in downtrend imo Those who bought the dip gonna runs out of money soon and they can't buy another deeper dip (LOL) Next dip: $15K $ETH  $MANA  $SAND  $CEL  $SOL  $LUNC  $LUNA  $NEAR  $DO
what is support level for low. looking for another buy position
Guys Better invest in BTC Eth is going to fail
all you delusional bottom feeders.: This epic failed project will not suddenly make you rich. Not with a burn not with anything. pump n dump now
Fantastic Nice going
will get killed by $PLS
Sold 50% of my $ETH  at 1600USD. If it goes down... good, i will rebuy around 1000USD. If it goes up... good anyway. And i will use the USDT to invest in other blue chips. I love this market cause it gives us new opportunities every single day.
going to collapse till 0,23 and below
Won't be able to unstake 6to12 months, won't collect award until upgrade. Lido only gives you 3.9 staking awards ETH will lose its decentralized form and will be a centralized/censorship chain when the merge happens Gas fees won't be fixed and scaling will be a problem. 
ETH going to lose a massive amount traffic to $ADA. 
soon fed rise interest 
LUNA  Sell your Luna if you bought the dip and invest in other coins and token. You can still make decent profit and recover some loss. Invest in $RVN  $LINK  $SOL  $ATOM  $ETH  $DOGE  Before Bull Ramp up.
Network that the only use is just to pump and dump jpegs
now this will dump soon because everyone is bullish
will likely touch $10-$12 in the next 2-4 months before markets starts it’s recovered. Easy 10-20x after that
its going down to 15k wake up people. 
cpi index smashing us hard today
Low value stablecoin, always will be.
8 cent stable coin. Need I say more?
ada is gonna destroy centralized bnb
is inflationary so much supply there will be more xrp in the market and it will drop more
Won't be able to unstake 6to12 months, won't collect award until upgrade. Lido only gives you 3.9 staking awards ETH will lose its decentralized form and will be a centralized/censorship chain when the merge happens Gas fees won't be fixed and scaling will be a problem. 
some new gem will come but not 
this project is totally useless. Nothing is happening on this chain. SELL NOW. 
merge will be a flop nothing is going to happen. miners are packing up and picking other POW chains. ETH was only popular bc of miners nothing more. layer 2 will build a bridge too other layer 1s and ditch ETH. eth maxipads "must protect my bags and need to lie too the ppl"
don't buy now wait for breakdown 
did not break the 23k level and we in a bearish flag, so downside next to about 20.7k then after that to about 18 to 17.5k then even below that as we got to make lower lows still unfortunately. 
people are abandoning the project...get out now
bounce to dip
can't dump alone even stocks haven't responded to the inflation data.. Lets wait for 27th
Fake pump is over
Hope they finally get their failures under control
fake pump ETH. Soon will go under 1k.
a great coin for short gains.
Smoke and mirrors. Short it
biggest ripp of in History of crypto high gas prices. no mad supply I smell trash
lower levels coming soon. I،¦m going to sell everything and wait several months
the global economic crisis is still going on and will continue for some years later
BOOM!!  there it is wait dont buy right now lower lows 
There is no support until $20 thats where im buying
L1 narrative is dead. ETH has upgraded. The future is in Ethereum now.  All problems Ethereum has before have been eliminated. No need to develop on shit unsecure chain like this when Ethereum is good now. Sell while you can other L1s will slowly die.
you are all crazy. here in LUNC there are two types of investors. -those who bought high and now have lost everything -those who bought very, very cheap and who will never win anything. a great vicious circle closed. all run like puppies around the tail
I recommend not to avoid it, it will blow your mind!
will done ..70% run out 
Time to cash out SOL boys.
next big stock drop btc will go to 17k
BTC  Those we are keeping long on with more than 10X cross, please don't do this. We are in a bear market market and history repeats same as 2017 that too we have so much pressure from all Govts.  $BTC   $ETH   $OP   $SOL   $LUNA   $FLOKI    $BNB
price is just a hype. A chain with a lot of stops and scaling problem only worth less than $5. Just be careful!
this is overrated. Actual price is around 100
if you care for your future financial situation please sell Solana, it's really easy to see it already failed
only bears insight, unless interest rates start dropping. 
Dead is dead and it is finished
We are finding resistance on our dump line from the previous dump. If we can脌 break above this line and hold it, a dump to the downside is increasingly likely.
this is not good investment anymore
I choose and confide in this project as well!
the FED is going to hike up the rates and already provided hint to counter inflation. massive sell off end of this week to next week. if it happens we could see another few k drop. get ready for some amazing payout from the moon hodlers. 
the ultimate shitcoin 
Now Up, then down is imminent in next hours
BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $USDT  stocks are dying. guess what is next
look at that BEAR FLAG FORMING on the 30 and 90 day charts HOPIUM SMOKERS!!!
doesn't have any future, the chain was hacked constantly and with a lot of downtime. The team is not reliable either, just junior developers selling an idea
Last pump waiting for a dump again !
I can see the bottom of ten thousand right now supper bearish
looks at my house no
500 will be the bottom 
phone is scam project
game over. this thing is dead
will vanish after sec trial
Buying for Long term and take Sell Trade 
I was telling all of you sheeps about real value of #luna ponzi shitcoin, but you kept throwing money out of the window
my favorite joke : $ADA holders lmao. 
definitely a stable coin 
will dump again soon
Will keep decreasing, is not crypto winter, is world winter, all will be down stocks & crypto
Bearmarket should stop at:
there giving out free ADA at the Fluff & Cux, Tooshies getting shoulder rubs while holding L's. The only top ten crypto to dodge bull runs every time. 鴂
ALL these worthless "Upgrades" and a "Hardfork" are just smoke and mirrors to hide a TERRIBLE Coin that's down -80% in ONE YEAR!!!  Go with BTC & ETH and stop being an ADA cheapskate...
BTC  $ETH   $BNB   $LUNA  $SOL  $DOT  $AVAX  $MATIC  The stronger the throw down, the higher the bounce will be.  I'm just worried that you don't have time to fill your bag
You All Guys Wrong This 8 Year Bear Market Continuing So Short Trade Is Best In This Bear Market Crypto Rekt Your Money So Don't Invest In Altcoins Only BTC Is Better For Long Term Best Of Luck 
while the price of ETH is going down.. The price of GULF is going up..
If we break 0.0001 resistence its over... we go to 0.00001
agent BTC 007 : not time to buy 
this project is kinda disappointing.
ETH IS A SCAM RUN BY A SCAMMER .
best time to sell you can buy again at 800 to 1000 usdt after few days
fed soon. bearish.
the whole market still trending down. dca in
this coin had its day & will prob be the next Luna and dump hard.  Reposition yourself w a lower cap coin that can actually make you some money for once.
buy any cryptocurrency just not Luna let's make a point that we are not going to put up with being scammed
Will fold, drop. 29$ targets
A long way down to go yet. 
will be replaced by ada. The account model is not scalable to serve millions of users and the merge wont solve anything in terms of fees
bye bye see u next year 
25 dollars next then to 5usd and hold. sorry to say guys cycle is over. All eyes are on BTC
bull trap done. Big dump over the weekend.
*War is not over
If there is a POS, then the trust in eth will fall. Why ? 1 Will lose decentralization 2 AMD, NVIDIA and Miners have invested a lot of money without them, the price will definitely fall.
huge head and shoulders. I联 definitely buying sub .30
next LUNA for sure
Dump it all. The leak is real. He did a Response and admitted all! 
seems like this is currently a bull trap until 50-70 and then will proceed to drop to just above 1, BTC with the head and shoulders is also just a bull trap, expecting sub 19 by the end of the weekend.
They will dump it back to 1k
my intellect tells me bearish
And all the way back down
if you think guys sol iis not react like luna then invest  more money in this coin
- House always wins !! Stop gambling - Most of the crypto web solutions are weak and offer no value - Until solid solutions are built on top ETH - It will go nowhere
stay away from this non scalable chain. It uses the account model, it will collapse when it reaches 300 million ACTIVE users
shit like it was from beginning.
Heading to 300 new low
$USDD say good bye to your money!! Ponzi, scam , shit coin
Cardano will be out of the top 10 this year 
didn’t I told u guys it will dump
Without realizing it, we have fallen into the trap of a superpower country that is in need of large funds to support Ukraine
Destroyed me very very badly .. lost all of my life savings
i sold all ethereum,
is the next $LUNA  Be prepared!
This is essentially a centralized PoS Ethereum. It suffers from mostly the same problems as Ethereum since it's EVM based. The only diffrence I can see is the fact they traded decentralization for speed. (Like most other "ETH killers") And 42% of the initial supply went to the team, while only 16% went to the public sale. I'll say it: It's a VC pump and dump.
is bearish in weekly chart
will go down to 900 before merge
I donot belive crypto.It isfully scam
enjoying the ride to the bottom
I think down the road
Doesn't it feel good to do such a nice job? It's a pleasure to teach you when you work ___.
always hack. Warning
Fake pump will crash to $800-$1000$ETH 
it won't survive the court case 
Most people here don،¦t know about Neon EVM. Soon ETH dapps will enjoy native Solana speed and fees. They،¦ll be using the Solana network while maintaining ETH compatibility. No need for Ethereum 2.0, PoS transition. It،¦s already here.
ready to time asia  Big Crash Coming
I am still at same position. Eth is little bullish for short time period. Within 2 or 3 days it will touch 1300 to 1200 after that wick will go down round 900 to 1000. 
every space needs to be filled, 
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven, when I awoke I spent that on a bitcoin. 
this crap is dead get real
So many of you will be disappointed on September 22. Can脌 wait to read the comments 
pump and dump shitty
put a fork in her, she's done
did you notice Bitcoin following ETH yesterday and it will again today. We don脌 need Bitcoin as king anymore. It䏭 too bipolar and will always drag down the market. Let䏭 crown a new king and the time is now. $BTC $ETH $ADA $SOL
I think if you wanted to make a profit, you had to buy at 0.00001675 and sell at 0.006. It's hard to accept that but you have to be realistic and move on.
bearish, may not fail but certainly will not do as well as others long-term
sell sol buy avax
literally the worst, only idiots have this
centralized and without max supply defined.
centralized, people have abandoned the project, it will fail in short due to constant bugs and shutdowns....it's not a proper chain to handle people's money or let alone massive adoption
Bear flag in a bear flag?
Like BTC moonboys, everyone is FOMOing into the merge news that was priced in months ago. ETH will dump soon after but moonboys keep piling in and get REKT time and time again. Its like watching a woman get beat by her abusive BF and go back to him after he says he is sorry and he has changed. Its total BS, but she goes back anyway and gets another beating.
every couple of days I come here just to check if there are still any fools left investing in this dead, abandoned scam coin..
is a dead project, tokens are not burned, but new ones are minted
I am selling all my Dot, will buy back once it will reach $2.5
it’s still the sellers for me.
like if bearish incoming
Don't buy this shitcoin! Ponzi scheme!
I am bearish about: $BTC  $ETH  $ADA  $LINK  $DOG
I still couldn脌 believe my eyes there are people ask others to buy the dip. for f sake, the price is going down now so if you buy you are most@likely to end up negative right? so why buy the DIP? Evil idiot! 
Going into the shitter faster than a mexican at a bbq
Look out big dump incoming
this project is kinda disappointing.
after the hack ppl lost trust in this
sold mine last week for 29 just to see it crossing 42 today.
Ethereum will never beat Bitcoin because of the GAS fees and limitless coin creation. Never bought it and never will!
sell this shitcoin
soon major bull trap all the readings are waaayyy low!
Moonboys all hot and bothered over FED day..they think they will get the bounce to new ATH. You fools are delusional you are all going to go broke. Its Ok ill be there to buy your panic sold worthless bags when BTC is like 5K in October. New ATH may never be seen again, 30K will be a struggle. BTC is done, the world has lost faith in it
Bscscan shows us, that we are still in a downtrend :( I expected still a 20-25% drop on all cryptos $BTC $ETH $BNB $XRP $ADA $SOL $DOGE $SHIB $AVAX $MATIC 
I am bearish on 
Still bearish, as recession coming in Europe and USA, the cinese situation and the war in Ukraine will bring the economy much more down. we haven�脌 seen the bottom still so wait for it this winter. Still think we are going to 11/14k 
pump hard dump harder
with their coin-phone is scam!
we are taking these crooks to court. the Blockchain outages violate US code 13678 along with 135667 and the US Constitution. Solana soon will go to 0, and the devs know it! 
we are going donw..
My target is 17,500 $BTC  Dump the fake pump. Do not buy this little hype before another correction.
following the same may/june pattern...false bull, will keep getting red by tomorrow
Fake Bull is dead, 10k is the goal!
oh no I better sell my deflationary Bitcoin! did you hear Powell? Interest rates are going up to combat inflation!! 
no.  Stick to Bitcoin
you will tell you kids one day that you missed buying SOL at 30
insecure and not scalable, it will vanish by next year
unlock my airdroppsss
bargain price. Buy now, and plant the seed. Soon you will have a noticeable difference!
it will gonna fall harder 
I wish good luck to the team!
Awesome I like the way you settle down to work.
I think it will dump big time 
Alert trapping now ready to dump. stand by,  $15 soon
eth 1600 doller one hour left selling now
This coin keeps going down. In this rate, it will go out of top 20 in a month or so.
They USE FOMO to take our money from deluded get rich media stories.
trapping now ready to dump. .. stand by ..$15 soon...
can the dip just happen already so we can move on and start a bull market. This bear market is getting very tiresome. 🙃
who's bearish on $ETH like this post and show other people too
By Dec to Q1 Q2, BTC will bleed to 13k to 8k range. If inflation does. It come down to minimum 4.5% or 5%, nothing will be bullish. Wait to invest, not now, not yet. Wait for Dec at least. Just a quick few months to get nest price.
I'm glad I sold solana at price over $200.
sell before it is too late
$BTC  $ETH  $USDT  $USDC  $BNB  SELL YOUR SOL the chain is too new and will continue to have massive insecurities and issues, and slow transaction speed
BTC $ETH $USDT $BNB $LUNC Binance is already the object of several U.S. investigations. Hackof Eterbase, association with Korean hackers Lazarus & Russian drug mart Hydra. Binance was also partner in crime with Scammer Do Kwon. Binance is going to collapse.It is a fraud heaven.
all crypto is just one big ponzi scheme.
1.5 million ETH sent to Binance. Preparing a sell off ? 
BTC dont have any support level right now. It didn't get a bigger volume. May be it should touch 19K today. Stay tuned. 
can believe this shits still alive lol
ast week was a green week. This week I summon a red week. Here's the first red candle!
another play pump and dump
totally shitcoin coin dump hard more likely.. peoples start dump now
BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $XRP  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE   $DOT  $SHIB  WOW. The market seems to spike up for only a few moments only to crash down immediately. Who would have known? #FeedingTime  #BearMarket
The price will be paid one day for separating from the central authorities. The banks, global financial powers & whoever else can afford to be.   Has Bitcoin been tainted by SilkRoad & money laundering schemes? Or will the power of cash & cc's come under the same scrutiny?
meh lawsuit supressing price? we shall see…
The Videos are very likely real.  His statement against it was also vey weak.  Everything just fits too well together.  Its really sad to see and i also liked AVAX before that.  But this..... well i don't want to be involved into such a criminal project.  And as long as there are no real proofs that the videos are fake, i will keep my attitude.
Going to down again..be alert
This is Fake Pump Trape very soon
As cheap as it could ever be right now. Lucky buying at these prices.
Binance has offered the companies that were built on the LUNA chain a new home on the bnb chain. this is not good news for LUNA. But the companies that were built on the LUNA chain can save themselves.
Elon Musks son wants to bea trans girl and have nothing to do with him. sounds like its time for another meme, maybe, ELONTRANS INU? Man, crypto is so gay
people still fall for it again eve after Luna debacle in May.
Nice pump again, then rugpull..
it's gonna be all over
not fake news
down to bottom soon
has never gone up after an upgrade.  There is always a sell off after each platform upgrade.  The price run up has already been priced in.  It will drop after the upgrade, you will lose then and it will be a long time before you make your gains back - hear me now, believe me later.
more likely to tank sorry moonboy sometimes you need to be a bull and sometimes bear lol it is nearly validate it is the bear market lol
I have a feeling we are going to see some more down side till we get the upside
hese moon bois really need to wake up and realise that we are in a bear market. ATH wont come until atleast 2024 during the bitcoin halving. BTW before any numnuts starts attacking, I sold close to the previous ATH, while all you were holding and waiting for "$100K bitcoin at the end of the year" in 2021, pathetic. 
Many people are forgetting SOL is still in Beta. It's a good thing they are fixing the bugs now not later when it's in Production.
BTC  $ETH  $ADA  $XRP  $ALGO  $DOT  $SOL  $BNB  $DOGE   Guys, remember that millionares are made in bear markets! Don't be a tourist, take advanatge of this opportunity to buy good crypto coins/tokens. If you take advantage of this, you will be winning once the bull returns!
will dump hard after merge
not can go to the mooon💩
is next Luna. ponzi
Elon officially sees Doge as a simple meme and nothing more, and developers are too lazy to improve, giving the excuse that you don't change what's good. Don't be fooled by recent partnerships, they are either useless or over-promoted. Like, what % of the public buys tickets in Doge? Partnerships should grow the community, not add more echo-chamber material for the people already in it. I mean zoom out to 1y and 'all', it's going down. Without Elon's full backing it's not going up. Knowing Elon is sorting his Twitter mistake, he probably won't even look at Doge. If you're holding a big bag, man you do you.
olana is going down soon guys watch out.
i lost all my fucking money on this dog shit coin, you will suffer.
I told you all that BTC is going down to hell and you耱l thought it a joke... Don脌 fall for the ant hill been made by whales these season
performance is crap.
wie die meisten bei einem Tief rumheulen zirka vor einem Jahr war das selbe rumgeheule dann im Herbst wie alles wieder raufging hat sich jeder aufgeregt warum er nicht gekauft hat 
unreliable, made by junior developers
market will dump soon 
will be the next LUNA
I got liquidated at 1695, what does that tell you about manipulation
back to last year dip 12
soluna is about to go 20% dip after the hack, there are sell orders for massive amounts
According to the graph and the estimates for ETH they look very bad, it seems that soon another crypto will take its place and this one will leave the top 5, remember that your active CEO has lost a lot of money and bankruptcy speculation is huge !!!
to 3$.   going to be replaced by $aptos next bull run anyway.  solana's USP's of low fees and quick tx is now disappeared into dust.   no good dapps on solana either lmao.  easily a 0.5 bil project or less
only buy @ 500, it will get at 10k in 2 years from now, just trust me.
Astounding I like the way you've handled this.
hahaha imagine trusting these clowns with a V2 to do it all over again! Goodbye to algorithmic. Let's stick to the stuff actually backed by USD.
Cardano will crumble. IOG is too focused on Africa. 
Out of top 10 this year 
No soul left!!
If anyone says "Back then you missed Solana", we can correct them.
bug brings down Solana. Again،K
We wont see another bull run until etherium bottoms out at around 1200.
future ranked just below $AVAX
Defintely headed for a 1k.
all crypto up,this shit no,omg what must be stupid to have ada :
LUNA is a dead scam coin that scammed a bunch of useless Luna maxi got rugged bc they thought $LUNA is a "investment" I'm glad they lost everything. they deserve it. now go buy the real projects like $ADA $BTC $ETH $XRP buy these coins and hold and stake. ETH bridge to ADA NFT
sol wallet is been hacked 
Next Luna guys. Game with crypto is over and i hope people will escape from this illusion of nothing.
get ready for a selloff xD
anything below 50 is buy for me
This people want to scam us again
watch what happens around Wednesday morning!!! The FED is Meeting again and expected to raise the Interest rates 75 more points!!!  Another big Dump is Inevitable 
sold out of $DOT  for more $STX
Ethereum dumping due to a vulnerability found in ETH2 chain, "The Ethereum beacon chain experienced a 7-block deep reorg. Current attestation strategy of nodes should be reconsidered to hopefully result in a more stable chain!"
binance crashed UST.   to strengthen bnb stable
created by the owner of mt.gox, expect it to go bye bye soon.
Bitcoin must collect liquidity from the bottom before going to the pump! So expect a sharp dump this week! ����
So many people here will lose all their monies.
staking is not liquid staking bc it's locked up for 12 months. lido staking pool can only give you 3.9 staking awards and won't be able to collect until other upgrade. nothing in the white paper say it will give you 8% staking awards that's total false. 
will go down badly 
caution  book profit and exit two major factor 1) US recession 2) China - Taiwan conflict now on a face of war, China will follow Russian statics on Ukrain. pls save your money and have patience and look fwd to 2023 Q1.
It will go down day by day, the code is pretty bad and some software design decisions they made are built up into the core. That's not something you can refactor at this point. This project has failed and it's not scalable. When will it collapse? depends on how fast user amount grows. If Sol reaches active millions users in a couple of months you will see the end of Solana quicker than expected
BTC  Laser eyes get ready! 20K support is far too weak. $BTC  is set to fall to 13K and quite possibly 8K and below. Pucker your buttholes and mentally prepare for another 50%-70% dip. $ETH  $ADA  $HBAR  $QNT  $DOGE  $XRP  $SOL  $BNB
: the price is very slowly increasing But if this continues, is an unkown. At the end of the september, the FED and the ECB are going to increase de rates. The cost of living will then rise. QT in america and Europe will olso have and effect on the price of assets, but more for the financial risky assets. In order to safely invest in crypto, you need money you can loose, with fear. And the investmentgroups are becoming smaller. The interest in bonds will increase, because it is a 'saver' asset. For the time being i am bearish.
don't buy all at once, the trick is to buy regularly to avoid whale traps :) $BTC $ETH $BNB $XRP $ADA $SOL $DOGE $SHIB $ATOM $MATI
THERES A COOKIE AT THE BOTTOM 
The Videos are very likely real.  His statement against it was also vey weak.  Everything just fits too well together.  Its really sad to see and i also liked AVAX before that.  But this..... well i don't want to be involved into such a criminal project.  And as long as there are no real proofs that the videos are fake, i will keep my attitude.
whoever who controls BTC just a son of a b!tch 
Fair price at 7 cents 
once ada releases hydra and pipelining Solana will be done....End of june
BTC  People will be mad salty when they realize this was a typical bear market rally and we are merely at the midway point of downward movement. Think logically. If the bear market is over, this will be historically the shortest, fastest bear market in history at a time when things have never been worse on the global stage. Limit the liquidity you provide for the manipulators and keep some dry powder on the side. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $SOL  $DOT  $DOGE  $QN
its bear market, it's gonna crash down so much more
account based coin, multiple hacks, constant downtime, untested bridges..what's not to like?
toxic for the space. Unreliable uptime. Hacks. It needs to go
BTC $ETH another fake Bull, watch out!
people i don¡¦t understand why you don¡¦t do some research, the last beae cycle eth dropped 94% , do your calculations this bear market is more terrible then ever war , inflation the biggest, global economy in crisis, so 94% drop as the 2018 bear cycles means 200-400$ etherum 
resistance at 1600 lets see if it breaks it 
bleeding. People found out the merge is not solving any of its issues any time soon
Will go down then buy it
*War is not over
is awesome and great buy level soon. Don't sleep on serenitycapital.co  though, up 90% today alone.
stay down bitcoin. do not go up
it will dump from here now 
LUNC  $BTC  $ETH  $LUNA  $BNB  if no burn during September then run away of this MAFIA who is controlling crypto. I mean run away completely out of crypto market
GET UP AND SHOW THEM WHO YOU ARE!
Fake pump, 90 % of bnb own by Binance and Whales. we can t move the price.  Thursday to 240 $ . Be careful
Better call Saul. AVAX is full of gangsters running a scheme. Do your research.
time to good bye, thank you be a big part in crypto. 'The Merge' is the biggers mistake u have done. 
im surprised people still invest in 
there are much better layer 1 solutions out there with way more upside potential. SOL is centralized and unstable, outright overvalued. DYOR!
In business there is a saying: There's the quick and the dead, ada is the second one. 
How do people trust this chain for real??!
The big question is: When will miners sell all their ethereum!? It seems they don't have another alternative, they simply can discard thousands of hardware, they will have to take profit of this pump, then invest and mine other mineable GPU coins, that eventually will grow i.e.: another ethereum fork, ETC, BitTube, Ubiq, Grin, etc.... What do you people think?
going to below 35 within a week
Ending for Do Kwon? I'm still holding LUNA and waiting for a miracle. The rest of my account I bought $RBIF , it made me feel safe if LUNA got worse.
Sell NOW or on the next available pump.. $22-$25 or less is coming for $SOL  soon! $NDQ (NASDAQ) is dropping off.. so $BTC  will follow.. $18K here we come!
get out before its too late  buy hbar or algo.
Cardano vasil update is 33% activated, it needs to reach 75% of nodes to be considered live. Say goodbye to your chain in 6 months
panic selling 
use your brain for god sake,
The bear is alive & well, don't believe the the perma bulls. They're the ones selling while they're telling you to hold (they don't want the competition) or to buy the dip (you're buying what they're selling)...
manipulation at work.. 80% of coins are centralised no   doubt. it's unfortunate 
come on dump I dare ;)
Better invest in Avax
is centralised coin, go look for what䏭 better don脌 lose money on this I脎e spent years that䏭 my conclusion 
don،¦t trust sol anymore moving my money to TRx for 30% f this bs 
buying and holding sol and sol nfts! 
The market manipulation is real out here ;(
Impossible to rise under the collapse and without the king, btc I don't care about the new update, fake flags for you to buy
Promising, is al I can say about Solana. Where Cryptocurrencies is concerned, technical analysis does not really provide true indication of where the price is headed. Market sentiments play the major role. Currently, I place my position based on hunch. There, guys! 
it is next Luna. sell #SOL and buy #DOGE , it،¦s next #BTC 
Bullish, this is a good buying opportunity. Continue buying into an corrections.
don't get caught in the bull trap the market isn't ready for this movement wait a little
scammy project. solunavax dropping like Flys. We're did the moon bios go what happen too this scammy project. lmaooo no one is building on solunavax anymore. 
old fashion shit
Sell now. It's heading to next support sub $8-$9. It's a long bear market.
same as $LUNA just a few days
maxipads always need to lie just pump they heavy useless bags.
will dissapear in short
POO DOGE PLEASE DO NOT BUY ANY COIN WITH MODIFIED CONTRACT.  Please, because they are repeatedly suspended by coin development and later change the contract again and release coins in the market.  This leads to typical clients losing their investment.
TC  $ETH  $BNB  $XRP  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE   $DOT  $SHIB  WOW. The market seems to spike up for only a few moments only to crash down immediately. Who would have known? #FeedingTime  #BearMarket
Better not to predict
bullish as hell
Made 10k from this dip in one night, let's keep it going people!
lol it's dipping more than BTC get ready for exchanges too buy the dip so losers will support this broken chain
USDT ponzi coin backed by nothing, they can mint any amount of usdt but when redeeming they can keep you waiting till they crash the market $BTC $ETH $BNB $ADA $XRP $SOL 
starting to lose faith in ADA it just doesn't deliver or hold up its price like ETH, SOL, or FTM. Still waiiiiiiiiiiiting for it to pop. Even when everything else was making crazy highs, it barely pumped.
0.00032 now looks good but in the long run I think it will drop again
ghost chain, soon not worth anything.
ETH $BTC bad time to buy rn I feel. seems like this pump is to dump in a week and then will crash lower. All tx to $LUNC and then the birth and crash of $LUNA and now $SOL on deathbed.
#indianproject #support india project
this lunc done kill me嵰
bullish as hell
after sec trial xrp whales will sell it all
looking for dump to 1400 range then 1200! remember this call when it happens! 
Macro factors are too much to overcome. I'm bearish in the short-term and bullish in the long-term 
BTC  $20,000 is an important mark price for Bitcoin, if it breaks, you better be prepared for another big dump, it's very not likely 19k and uptrend from then Alts: Pretty much wipeout, take months to get small recoveries $ETH  $CEL  $LUNC  $LUNA  $DOT  $NEAR  $GALA  $SOL  $AVAX
watching this dump is more enjoyable than watching a Biden speech. SELL
is like the law of jungle. Survival of the fittest only the strong survive 𣸮 
if somethings not working, you unplug it and plug it back in, it's that simple folks
long term eth holders are dropping the coin as we speak according to network activity
Crypto 100 percent centralized as it crumbles under every notice from the government.
it䏭 broken!!!!!! here we go
I¡¦m bearish didn¡¦t swap on time
it broke to downside no price action yet 
where are the merge nerds at now lol
nah do you want your funds to be stuck wen this blockchain shuts off again plus lock up staking lol that's old tech. get with a blockchain that doesn't lock your funds or shut off. that's ADA. 
Everything what Ethereum have failed to deliver all those years, have $CSPR which is ETH v3.0 and $DOT already delivered and accomplished! 
pump hard dump harder 
is the waste of time and money for now. avoid trading in it. if you hodl for long term then switch to another fundamentally strong coin.
crypto crash This Week end until the FED announcement This tuesday ( ETH no must bleed so much before a biiiiiig pump to the moon in september with the merge and the stabilization of inflation) 
failures and exposing issues lead to a more secure and stable platform. People don't get this. Solana is maturing before our very eyes and we're finding all the bugs and and errors. These guys have basically written their own code from scratch. Give the devs a break.
not fast enough.
going down for short period.
will It pump before crashing like luna? or Just crash?
SECOND outage in a month!!! no milestones upcoming! BE VERY CAREFUL with this one! artificially pumped! 
it will go down to 1k for the next coming months
the market not have any reason for other bullrun in this year. Global economy in crash, halving only in 2024, the BTC only went up because the PoS speculation about eth. 
this shitcoin has 200 days at the most before the big downward spiral to the crypto graveyard
biggest pump buying selling now 
I remember around Dec. 2021.  I sold my ADA bags.  I bought at around 1.50 and they dropped to below a dollar soon after.  I sold when it went back up to a 1.30, had a steak, a bottle of wine, and even a mango panna cotta.  Played that one right x
short term rally.  not buying BTC above 19k
Stop deleting my opinion. It's a trash project. CEO and team stole money from people. It's oficials news. You don't like the truth? They stole from you, pooled out money and live their best life. Look at 3 month chart. It went down 10000%. I would never trust again.
no movement at all. Big trouble in little Cardano 
far from the botom
is finished. Constant outages and hacks
I just opened a short, probably will close it and go long at 1250. i suggest doing the same.
They pump it like that so people invest, then they rugpull...
Ethereum and the whole crypto-market still has not seen bottom. You cannot enter a bull market in a recession, with both debt and inflation still rising and exceeding expectations in a negative direction. The math doesn't add up.
dead-cat bounce
hopefully next LUNA
read Red dit article: After part 1, PART 2: The Rabbit-hole That Lead To Do Kwon's Missing 80K(90K) Bitcoin
ETH  $BTC   $USDT  $ADA  $XRP  $SOL  $LTC     U.S. inflation is causing a Dip but that's a;sp the best reason to buy the tip , hold , staking with interest 8% , 10% ...   People that sell low , will get  in life what the caused to themselves ...
slowly leaving top 10, people lost interest
Ethereum price will be cake who crush by big truck tyres
Wow, why r they having so many problems now?  Can they fix all of the bugs? Very sketchy, stay away, I feel terrible for all the ppl that bought in at $140+ 
Ethereum's tokenomics and its "ecosystem" of ERC-20 tokens is one of the best disguised ponzi schemes ever. Buterin is playing a long game scheme so that he can keep his massive amount of wealth. He will get into politics later in life, just wait and see. It's all a scam.
new short bottom will be 1 .6k then push back up. August is always red for most crypto. 
Bearish. Trend towards historical support at 354. Operating range 354 - 1145.
how is the price in the green today with a 3.4M dollar scheme? ignorant money buys solana. #MATIC #ETH #SAND #BTC 
I Lost again with this
big crash is here. Bottom is gone!
sold my Lunc and bought $TLM it looks like better option to get 10x if not more! Im not gona invest in $LUNC anymore for a hope to get 3x-5x.
hit rock bottom and wavy just like $BTC   and $ETH
I،¦m bearish on this weekend
Never buy eth again ist scam for whales loser Coin better Look other Coin! vitalik is loser!! daemon!!!
2. miners will start sell they btc, to covers operating cost.
Powell announces more hikes needed. look out below. yikes. 
No one who is keen on crypto should ever miss out on the chance to participate in this innovatory product
back to 3 dollars?!
pump and dump scheme
will go down soon 𪊶
fat years are over
Bahahahaaaaa ! I knew this would happen to Bitcoin !  Bahahaha !
low volume because of maintenance/ new big update. Cant wait to see the new features i loved it before
the merge wont solve anything, still high fees and ethereum will have to go through matic for EVERY transaction to be cheap. Specially when you are signing a contract or doing some operation that requires more gas. The pronostic is pretty terrible, enjoy this little pump
BRACE, BRACE 𤨎 crash landing expected at 18.4K 
fishy business. dyor and you will see
BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $XRP  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE  $DOT  $SHIB  Betting on another crash real soon. Greed/Fear Index is still high, inflation continues and no big push to turn on the bulls? Yeah, hold off and you'll get positions not seen for a LONG TIME. Get ready if it goes up or not.
Fed News by Next Week. Bullish.
Where is the money coming from to but BTC or Altcoins? Leverage is at 0,3 an ATH. This is a rebound, butt it won't last. The macro economics is bad. Be carefull. I'm not buying.
and $BTC  have no use as an actual currency. (if the united states dollar droped 80% in a year people would be in absolute panic). It is just built on hype. And with a real currency you dont need to pay $100 gas fees. Drop crypto and embrace stocks.
expect a crash up to 50% soon...
Solana is like a bad relationship. If you go to bed and you don't know where your girl is. that's the time you should think about it. and what would you do if this girl repeat this shitmove more than three times :D Solana feels like Windows on 1995. Put that bluescreen away
soon xrp will loose lawsuit. 
disaster waiting to happen
Exactly right! Keep it up.
this is a bull trap and manipulation. anyone that thinks is a reversal needs to do more learning.
Pay attention guys to the big bankers they know what's up JP Morgan just said more storm clouds ahead for financial markets and this guy is a believer in #Bitcoin 
it will go down to atlist $3
oh crap I though this blockchain turn off ? yall heard about the new solunavax that the vcs building ? just wait until a bull market comes you'll see it. 
China selling faster than the world can buy.. that،¦s why price cannot climb anymore.. 
BTC is manipulated by the whale from 30K - 17K and today the whale will dump it below 10K.. save your fiat money. 
at least one last dump before finally going to the moon 
Doubtful volumes are emptying the market cap, is it 0.00032???
$USDD say good bye to your money!! Ponzi, scam , shit coin
It's amezing project and it's founder, don't buy now... wait for its price 1$. it will 1$ before bull run.
the "flippin" won't happen anytime soon or even after the merge. eth maxipads need to lie always just make a quick buck. 
cardano is so heavy to go up. its like theres an achor stuck on the ground
On 16 of August I told you guys that the weekly was ready to fall of a cliff.  Well now am telling you that the montly is ready to fall of a cliff...
I،¦m bearish on this coin
瞿12,000.00 will be the Christmas  early January bottom. 
ADA. I traded it previously  but only flow the music of $BTC  and $ETH.  Not good for time- investors.  $XEC  eCash  is good haven for investors and not even directly affected by 11 May 2022  Terra UST dive.
BTC $ETH big pump always before a crash happens dont invest dont FOMO we are still in a bearmarket 
with so many projects, $KUNCI is hidden gem . compare circulating supply with $SOL 
fake pump it will go 20k soon
SCAM!!!! Worst L1 EVER!!!
Hold tight guys Things are getting more Beefy 
Even now, we will fall very low 50% 
this shitcoin has 200 days at the most before the big downward spiral to the crypto graveyard
1 week go earth...$luna go dead today
glad I sold mine two days ago and pocket good profit, I buy again on Tuesday night, just before the merge date. 
It is really sad to see that most people imagine that merge will change the value of ethereum. The only true cryptocurrency is only Bitcoin. Expect a massive crash starting 9/19/2022
Totally loss trust
The 7 day is so ready to fall of a cliff...  Rip late bulls that bought above 1.9k  Index went for an inane rally and so did ETH, however the king BTC does not lie, not even up to 28k to reclaim prev dump...   Everything looking weak as hell.
I sold everything a month ago, when it hit $800 and ppl run in circles I'll buy again. Using BSC tho, otherwise the fee is absurd.
another hack coming soon 
i will laugh at you innocent people.. 
is dead after Merge, price will be down to 500-690 dolars max. he is not anymore coin, he is same shiba, doge token, meme coin. 
it will down gaian to 27k
perfect time to open short position, fake pump, dump incoming. Back to 1000
Creating bear flag till tomorrow possible target is 1458.. 1350.. 1250 easily  
I love all the uncertainty. so fun.
The second most dead Coin ever. Just behind the  Crypto village accelerator
I hope this project dies completly soon
giving up on this coin, earning less profit better than a big loss. These two days pump will have a huge negative impact on its price. 
Solana has to really tighten up their Security 
this hard fork solved nothing. Knowing ETH this "Shangai" upgrade could take years. Locking everyone who staked for eth 2.0 ETH is so centralized.
Save your money! Whole year market will fall! No Gains this year obviously $BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $ADA  $XRP
Guys be real we all saw the crash comming D:
the wortst token I have ever seen. 
I discovered this one when I've been looking for the project that matches all my demands.
so bad but wait
Look out for shady pumps & dumps. Can`t expect much without factoring in earnings and GDP along with CPI.
its going below $20 tomorrow
Bscscan shows us, that we are still in a downtrend :( I expected still a 20-25% drop on all cryptos $BTC $ETH $BNB $XRP $ADA $SOL $DOGE $SHIB $AVAX $MATIC 
USDT MC droping one Billion per week more peolple are fleeing, can Tether redeem all the 65 Billions, only time will tell $BTC $ETH $BNB $SOL $ADA 
9$ incoming. Giant head and shoulders. Blood in the streets for a rocky project that has dirty influence in the crypto space.
Bulls are in full denial, sell while you can.   You got a clear warning from me yesterday that the weekly looked like shit and was about to fall over a cliff. Will you listen this time around or are you gonna hold this position as well down to new lows?
I think Ethereum will go back down to touch the final bottom and rocket up for the September Merge..
People who talk about shitcoin amaze me. Solana is a true technological innovation. It's a beta, it has bugs, it fixes them. I don't understand this FUD of the little haters who discover the world of crypto and who cry all the time.
banker coin. bin it.
price too infladed, posible drops
is not the future at all, yes many crypto like eth could come with lowe gas. are you really gonna pay 100$ in gas for 20$ worth of grocery ?
same like terra Luna waiting for AVAX 2.0
maybe the SEC should investigate?
I think it's still a wrong time to invest 
YOU CAN NOT WITHDRAW AFTER THE MERGE 
stay away from this satan coin they are partners with WEF the people causing al the problems in the world
it¡¦s going down to $1830
On the road to centralized crypto
*Fed interest will be more higher. 
bitgert will replace it in the coming years
Shitcoin as always 
fish and chips say bearish brev
The cult of crypto. ADA holders are very aggressive. Not my fault that you胩e at a loss. Bad investment choice. Sorry about your luck. 
all fed bs aside the head over shoulders is 9k for BTC. you can definitely expect it to hit 11-13k this is not the bottom 
Don't try to catch a falling knife. $BTC  will drop below 10k in this bear market.  Here is the logic: this bull run was pushed not just by the halving hype, but also by insane money printing and money that people couldn't spend during the pandemic. Now both are gone. So 2 reasons to fall + maybe a housing market crash. So a drop more than -85% from ATH is totally reasonable (previous drop was -84%).
fake pump. all will see after merge what will happen.
sold if not want again poor millions to dollars like luna
Bitcoin will establish a new world order. But before the old criminal system, which calls itself "democracy", will kill hundreds of million of people by fighting to survive.
U.S. inflation is causing the financial market to collapse. 
Just fake pump and liquidity grabbing 
down to 1710 again and go straight before ultra dump with 2.0 ver
it's raining black swans
deleting my ewallet to avoid headache. forget and back to work is better than focus on crypto
crap coin #1, regular outages. I prefer $ADA  or even $ETH  over that $SOL  garbage.
bad for payments and bad for staking
Be careful, please. 
*Inflation is not over
going to 11k or even lower over next few months�� if you think otherwise you�胩e being decisive �� screen shot this
I'm bearish short term but bullish long term 🤔😅
staking is not liquid staking bc it's locked up for 12 months lmaoo what is this a bank ?
ada is killing eth
such a bad project, 7 downtimes,  lying about supply several times, very centralized and self orientated token distribution and not secure at all. Everyone that knows about blockchains stays aways from Solana they work on a phone now instead of fixing their broken chain.
i can taste that interest rate hike all ready.
The break down is here. GET IN TO CASH NOW
after Elon Musk went on SNL and torpedoed this coin I will never spend another dime on it
it will bearish the price is really heavy now,, this pump is a last pump of this months,, believe or not that's will happen soon
MATIC With $ETH v2.0 make Polygon, Harmoney ($ONE) and all 2nd layer useless and obsolete! Only suckers and losers use Layer 2! Price drop to rock bottom!
today midnight 19000 tirgate
Bull trap next week
Signal bearish for $BTC  The Chinese government has capitalized on the violent downturn in the crypto market by warning crypto investors that Bitcoin prices are ،§heading to zero.،¨
ETH $ADA will replace this patethic network, goodbye ether
will bearish by end of today 
 A lot of fake comments here for last months... 瘸nyway, this old luna token has 0 utility after the fall. It's now just a pump&dump trash.
Doge must die! Stay away this.
I have never been through any kind of bear market. I got involved in crypto in January of 2021. Ive never been through an actual relief rally because this bear market is so bad. Everything you learn in this bear market will help you so much when the next bull market starts.
To much Risk
I think a big crash is coming like luna sol is going 0.00005
If this month BTC go 19k and more down its not good. The good scenario is to do one last retest in 22k meaby 19800k and go up after 
I'm bearish in the short term ( 6 - 12 months) and Very Bullish long-term, 12 - 24 months Bitcoin will be $100,000 plus
solana soon out of the top 10, it will be replaced by doge from what I see
I don’t think we gonna to recover the 900 like a few weeks ago but 1200/1350 why not.. a lot of fomo these times, DCA is the best option.. In anyway we’re still in bear market and nothing is done yet.
Everyone go and closed your tarfe Eth will big dumped coming first terget 1320 2nd 1000 3rd 880 
poo coin .  The Network more down than up ,network getting slow and congested  , DDOS Attacks make the network go down for few days sometimes!?!? This is really not acceptable!   I really don't know why Solana is still in Top10...
How long will the price stay down?
Excellent Keep up the good work.
keep holding until it breaks 1795 and down position it is
and there goes the pump
its raise again because eth is pump, eth holder is exit before the merge happen to reduce risk
the bears are back in town 𦅚𦅚𦅚
solend just took control of a whale's wallet, in an "emergency" voting. 
Someone has the keys to the treasury so it is not decentralized
selling now this sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sel

GOD BLESS..
not looking good. Excited to see how crypto will react to the announcements at 28/7 
eth user base has been declining 
lmao BTC us pumping while ETH is down. a sign of a dump coming soon. 
Im waiting for sol to wakeup. Im bearish but I loaded up more sol right now. I hope I made a good decission.
pure manipulation 
John is one of the best investors I've ever know this year. I think she should be given such an award.
there it is... and this time it'll go down hard. you know what to do, don't you? $USDC ... just saying. stop your losses. 
managment, great team. To the moon?-Why not? Buy now its not too late #GulfCoin #Gulf_Coin $GULF 
CMC deleted my 2 viral information about $BTC  bearish. 
the best way to lose ur life savings
fake pump before a big dump sell now!
is getting in a big trial like ripple did, sell now
Has to attack superior tech to keep them down. The superior tech will win no matter what. AVAX is a shitcoin.
centralized trashcoin...stick to ada
due to high price high loss for investors so it is hard to raise the price
every day I wait for my $250 trigger to hit،K what is taking so long? thoughts?
end end end the end is near sol
not to the Moon To the Crash
has failed to be adopted. The account model it uses didn't let it moon
nah man cant go up because of hackers and other regional warfares so its bearish
will hurt moonboys on its way down to 10k.
is gonna go down,sell now before add 3zeros
is going to self destruction. It's jus scam!
how are y،¦all so dumb to be bullish،K.? eth is already unusable with the fees. it has no future in finance & once eth 3.0 comes out this will be an inflationary Ponzi scheme just like all staking coins،K 
bearish signals. if you are bullish this week, don¡¦t blame the market when it drains your portfolio.
bull trap be careful guys FED announces were not so good and SP500 companies balance sheet were not so good too.. look at the graph.. sp500 will go down soon, BTC follow sp500 and crypto market follow 
I read about so many crypto companies filing for bankruptcy right now.  hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their investments or are waiting to recover their money... we can make some money, but lets face it: we need a reset. 20k, 17k and even 14k will be reached this year. so good luck, guys!
don・t buy this rubbish it・s currently being hacked. Wallets are being drained.
omg bearish again lol
BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $XRP  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE   $DOT  $SHIB  WOW. The market seems to spike up for only a few moments only to crash down immediately. Who would have known? #FeedingTime  #BearMarket
after marge u see big dumped 
it's a trap. be careful $BTC $ETH 
as i said earlier,macro is shity and Black Rock gonna buy BTC cheap...𣸮
I am selling all quantity u will be sell now because biggest lower sarcket ETH 10%nigative down now 
Stay calm.. It wil go down to 1050 for sure.. See the market cap. Wait to safe your funds..  Atleast 200 value will decrease in next few hours. Fake pump also expected so dont jump in
sold my SOL! Downtimes and now the blockchain clock is running behind. It،¥s a bad designed vc project. There are definitely better projects out there.
3. People will panic once btc move below $17,000
BTC  People will be mad salty when they realize this was a typical bear market rally and we are merely at the midway point of downward movement. Think logically. If the bear market is over, this will be historically the shortest, fastest bear market in history at a time when things have never been worse on the global stage. Limit the liquidity you provide for the manipulators and keep some dry powder on the side. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $SOL  $DOT  $DOGE  $QNT
trx will die soon
1100$ will hit in 2-3 weeks, don't walk in bull trap!!!!
eth 2.0 will flop regardless what ADA dose its not possible for the model to be sustained for a long period of time hence the delay .. just a heads up unless you get in early avoid that 1
BITCONNEEEEECT!!!! get out of this... its all a scam project. A phone? Come on!
short short short please go down
The CPI inflation rate is seen hitting 8.8%, though Deutsche Bank economists are predicting 9%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
will be killed by ada in short
just cashed out sorry sol it was a good year
FED gonna talk in 10 min... They gonna pull out money that upholds house loans....
How much lower is it expected to go? thanks in advance
This token is like a trap tool when you enter, you must be trapped in a loss, this is the owner's game
not time to buy. Waiting till bear is full
Appreciated I like the way you're working.
will crash after "the merge"(which doesn't solve any of eth problems btw). Stick to ada
I am getting tired of holding this.
is officially partnered with the WEF, the most hated organization ever. 
this coin has been rejected by the community after the big hacks it suffered. Out of top 20 soon
took gains. it's a fake pump. will see crypto has a whole dumping. more dumps then riase. incogneto is my bihs has well. lmaoo dude has no life. short eth. wait for the merge. ETH has a failed transaction you pay for that. you need to send eth buy other shitcoins like matic.
FED... MTGOX...WAR... and this people its bullish. I dont undestand
why people put their money in a sinking ship? It's a coin without any development, just community with a gazillion of supply. Wake up people!!
like luna .. just yesterday a hacker stole from sol network 572m
was breached and easily hacked, protect your investment gents and take your money out, these developers are juniors
Highest users per month, growing rapidly, and has some great backers. All the VC unlocks to sell has happened this chain is looking very promising and with ETH delaying even more i think Sol can take some real estate developer wise from ETH.
BTC, ETH, MATIC all serve a need & accomplish things and earn money.  DOGE coin and other flim flam useless coins that have accomplished nothing will be outlawed soon and fall by the wayside. Fed・s are carving out crypto regulation laws now so be warned 
BTC  Bank runs have begun in China, depression has not yet been announced, and governments being overthrown worldwide. Expect more pain before the elites finally "reset" the global financial system. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $BNB  $DOT  $DOGE  $XLM  $XDC
will fail after Vasil sees no effect
be careful fake pump then hard dump
I'm more bullish on ada, eth uses the account model, I don't see it bulling long term
ETH so if you post $0xBTC or $USDT  $SOL  any post on any currency post and it will post on all the other market posts???
this shit don't stop
bad news coming guys from the PRE-FED that means the stock market is going into the red
still bearish until the merge. We might see sell the news with the merge. 
where are all the retards and moonboys saying Bitcoin will hit ATH soon? Last days were an authentic circus of clowns. You understand sh*t.
Check out the leak on Twitter. and better leave AVAX!
again massive fake pump 
Now Time To Dump 
Losing holders. The dream is over.
will vanish, it has terrible software design, it's non scalable, not ready for massive adoption...as soon as you double the users it will collapse hard. Also, it's super centralized.....stick to ada
This shitcoin was the biggest failure in crypto history. You bottom feeders will never get rich. Its a ded shitcion
bigger dump coming
prices in June will wait for July and buy at the end of June !!!
Bearish because I’m bearish on Bitcoin and think in the coming days it’ll have much needed pullback. It can’t break critical levels of resistance I think we go back down to support before we go up to a new high
My my! A rollercoaster with only bottoms! All aboard!
he weakness of the trend is found in two frame time Although the flag/triangle is formed. Without a purple hunt can also have a fall  $BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $ADA  $XRP  $LUNA  $LUNC  #BTC  #BITCION  #Analysis
bull trap bull trap bull trap. sideways for a very very long time new 52 lows to come.
going down. Network fails every time,  look at the facts! Head and Shoulder will give us a nice short opportunity.
scam, run boys run
it's a dream city here. Wake up and see the facts.
will once again drop to $900, see below
will dump because of CPI in 2 days an Federal Reserve ... i am bullish butbfirst we schould wait Till 26.07
This coin is a time bomb in the short term, the pin is already out with the binance annoucement yesterday. How can this coin stand on the top 20 in market cap with holders that wanna quick profit
sold all my eth 2 days ago. Not trying to play waiting game to reach max. profit. Now I just wanna buy more eth.. when has there ever been a moonshot without a falling shortly after
bagholders how are you doing today?
I'm keep buying it, the more it dropes the more I will buy.
SOL will not rise for some days.
Weekend pump and dump starting a bit late due to all the moonboys getting REKT on Friday. 22K then dump again..people never learn the whales have you all by the balls.
SCAM. Will go to 0
BTC  Bank runs have begun in China, depression has not yet been announced, and governments being overthrown worldwide. Expect more pain before the elites finally "reset" the global financial system. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $BNB  $DOT  $DOGE  $XLM  $XDC
next system crash soon ....
it is a bear flag, it will come down. Seeing comments here covince me of that as you need buyers to step in and they still do. bottom is in when they run out of cash or give up or step in cautiously. sorry it is what it is.
 in here the whale doesn't want to buy a lot of bitcoins, some are waiting at the price of 12k 
wow, I am worried, where do you think BTC will arrive?
if btc down,eth double down!!!
shit like all crypto. thaks God i never belived in crypto, even when was high.
how are my bagholders are doing today? charles have gone on vacation in Africa while you struggle (instead of upgrading cardano as he promised)...any problem with that??
see you at 550 you useless piece of coin
venture capitals are waiting for this to pump so they can exit....they already saw the outages and hacks and knows that it's a bad investment...just by looking at the code you can tell it's made by junior developers...stick to ada
story token, everyday new story what a sht.
Be careful another bulltrap
big damp comin up in 3 days
$SOL   commercial blockchain , crash every day , not scalable , centralized , lol what a nice eth killer :---)  with 0 utility ... garbage
there is so much investment from wallstreet now that when the stocks crash, btc and crypto will tank hard. As they will pull their portfolio out of high risk assets. This gradual incease in stocks and crypto always seemed illogical, but now im pretty certain a huge dump is coming.
take your profits now before whales take it from you
The low bitcoin price, rising electricity prices and high inflation are forcing mining companies to get rid of their bitcoins
just hanging out at 20k, no breakout foreseeable 
better I'm thinking to sell all ETH 
running kinda flat ATM. best time to DCA. We are still in a bearish market, and will likely be for a while. 
sell this shit, it's going to 3 bucks
will pump again within 48 hours
don،¦t buy , buy BP beyond protocol 
It will crash further down. 
no support at 20K bulls get rekked
finally dropping like a stone. Sell now or regret later.
CMC deleted my 2 viral information about $BTC  bearish. 
Liquidate shorter at the top of the range at 26k and go to 18k 
way overvalued, will lose huge market share soon
Not even inculding the hack, solana is too young of a network and far too ambitious, dont expect conscestantcy, and it may even die out in the next year
Extereme fear price will plummet to 17k - 18k range only reason price would go up now is market manipulation by some big company be wise and patient good days will come
I invest 5 months ago 3500€
BTC  People will be mad salty when they realize this was a typical bear market rally and we are merely at the midway point of downward movement. Think logically. If the bear market is over, this will be historically the shortest, fastest bear market in history at a time when things have never been worse on the global stage. Limit the liquidity you provide for the manipulators and keep some dry powder on the side. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $SOL  $DOT  $DOGE  $QNT
this is a bull trap. look at the entire crypto space and world economy. there is 0% that etherium will he the only asset in crypto that goes up. next week the fed rate hike will bring eth to $800. sell now and buy doubke in 6 days.
should of pulled out at 50. if it hits 40 im selling. Sol will be back, just not now
US Inflation increase, ETH will down sale for safe
Market is crashing
hello everyone BTC very soon fall to bottom it is just swinging before fall so my advice to all day trades be careful and sold out all your bitcoins 
scam, 0,01$ coming soon. developer donkey. 
will go back to .03 again
risk!  can't go more it will down..
insecure network, the code is really bad, go take a look for yourselves
The Winter has come... Sol will touch all time high in 2025
extremely oversold. get ready for liftoff.
long live communism, long live the centralization of power.  Bitcoin and decentralization are dead.  Rich, millionaires and billionaires, donate all your bitcoins to the state/government. 
DO NOT BUY!!! The secrets behind Tron TRX has been revealed!!! Big dump coming soon!!!
Over priced global Elite agenda token. Let's take away POW so we can move to POS so the rich can only get richer. The problem with POS is it's a piece of shit, by making staking rewards more abundant for the rich. With POW at least we had a fighting chance. It was never about conserving energy and anyone who says otherwise has no clue what's really going on. There is no lack of energy in this world, only an abundance of rich and greedy people who tell lies to benifit themselves by minipulation common men. God will reward you handsomely in hellfire.
Falling like a rock but can immediately bounce back like a ball
this isn't the bottom
going down soon stay away from it 
no be rush I the rush only say make this year know pass me by 
very disappointing coin.. been listening to hype around this coin for far to long.. not convinced buy Monero 
emmmmmmm you are a glutton for punishment if you buy this token
will be $ 140 by Dcember , don't be a fool that sell low when can sell high !
it's definitely melting my wallet and not my face...
we胩e going to 17k mates!  take your seats and enjoy the trip, cause we胩e buying the dip 鍴
Fake pump, be aware!
hort bearish mode incoming 
dump it. Move to prominent L1 protocols with usefull solutions build on top of it.
time to die...
going to break 1600 support level might be 1200 too, and for new rally it will took 2 year's minimum, if USA 2nd quarter result also negative then the recovery phase will be 3 year minimum for average people holding eth at 3000or2800
Be Careful to Buy over 17..
$ETH $SOL all cryptos follow Bitcoin sadly….
can somone answer and make clean situation in binance about Lunc/Busd after 7 September? I am on binance and shoud I stay on binance with mu Lunc/Busd afer this date, will I loose my lunc, or shoud I move somewhere else?
The last slice of LUNA cheese is sliding slowly off the edge of the biscuit. 🧀
Bearish -- mark my words.
This is a company that will change our future and bring cool technology to the masses!
i just got off the phone with Elon. He is a very good friend of mine, and we discuss Doge from time to time. well guess what, he's gonna dump it all. I'm telling u now so u can save your money!
It's funny to read comments from ppl that got into crypto last week and suddnely are "crypto experts". :D :D :D
you can be millionaire with doge but not this shit
Will it break below 20K today?
bots shill this shit vc blockchain. Don't fall for it. it won't pump after this weekend.
down to $10 soon
it䏭 a bear market max pain is coming
Told yall we would crash again.  :)
market very very very dem dem dem dem dem now 
buying short sell profit book now Selling 
accumulation at this price
this will drop down like a turd in a bowl
hacked dot will be destroyed by nervos network in the field of interoperability
is being rejected by the community, it failed way too many times, now they found another critical security hole, it will fall soon
When this project crush I lost a lot of money but I'm okay, I understand this is crypto. and now it's like a Meme coin no solid back up plan at all. So I switch to  $VVS  $SOLAR  $CORE  $SOLO  & $DARK  . Tell me you don't care..... I know! 鴂
might be a scam ?
$eth big crash the week end waiting the announcement of FED tuesday sell BTC now  (ETH no will have less crash before a big pump in september) 
guaranteed shorting this after it goes up another 100. market manipulation done by the big players. when it falls down then I¡¦ll buy spot.
lets buy the deep!!!
the leak is real! your boy did a Response Statement admitting it all! Better sell it now 
Best project ever, I am very happy to be participating in this project. I hope this project will gain more popularity in the future.  
: ETH will go up again, if the macro conditions will improve. See it form this perspective: ETH had al ATH price of 4750 dollars. If you buy ETH at 1400 dollars, it is possible that the price could drop by 50% to 700 dollars, but in a bullmarket it will increase tot at least 5000 dollars, an 350% rise in price. This is a low risk, high benefit position. Buy small, do not go in, all at once.
20K turned from support into resistance. August Jobs Report came back positive and bulls can't even get $BTC   to stay above 20K for more than 10 minutes YET these MoonBoyz have the nerve to get on here and say 30K soon!!!!! �鴂� Macro economic conditions are ominous. DXY is flirting with $110. Europe won't have enough gas to get through Crypto Winter. China's economy is about to crash and burn. China will then FULL SCALE invade Taiwan. DXY will shoot to $115 very soon. 10K $BTC   INCOMING. It's BEAR season.
it's a centralized protocol defi on solend and turned off couple times and had to restart the "blockchain" also has lock up staking. 
Sell for safe, US Inflation increase 9.1% very high risk
Since Twitter going down Elon will most likely stop supporting dogecoin lol.
SELL!! , I have been hacked LOST MY FUNDS!!!
BTC $ETH $SOL all cryptos follow Bitcoin sadly….
There is no buying in these stuff from now on. It was and always been a scam from start, Just to lure buyres and rip them off like ponzi scheme. Every Crypto is and always been of cost $0. Everything till now was just a bulls trap for loosers to buy in. Protect whatever you are left with and run from this PONZI.
shitcoin, volume down 50%
LEAVE THE SHIP NOW I REPEAT LEAVE THE SHIP NOW! NUMBER GO DOWN RED ALERT ! BUY LATER AGAIN WHEN NUMBER GO UP ! BUY HIGH SELL LOW !
will do like luna : sell now before regretting
Get out after Hardfork pump. Take profits, as this Coin will go down to .30 by Q2, 2023.
will dissapear between 2023 and 2024
not having a good pull these last couple of weeks
guys if any of u is trading trading eth please close that order Cox another big bearish is coming NFA
going to 1k again for sure
merge isn't what almost everyone think
BTC  $ETH   playing with fire. manipulation goes on with global economic collapse. crypto will the first fall hard. Everyone holds crypto assets will face deep losses. Start buying again after 1-2 years
S1: 1450$ S2: 1310$ S3: 1260$  Ethereum Futures remained in backwardation
I am very happy to be participating in this project. It Is Recommended To My Crypto Friends.
will go to 0 just like Luna! They already have problems with the Soled protocol that can،¦t provide liquidity!!! 
I'm so happy!! I put a Short of 1.3 BTC @21,600
Waiting for another scam :) Shit coiin))
here is the beauty, it䏭 likelihood to go down even more because Mt Gox investors are going to flood the market with BTC right after waiting for years so yea go buy the dip and you will pour your money into others pocket. 
Bank owned. google ethereum alliance. you welcome
A and $LUNC seem to be converging: to $0. 
dumping to one dollar soon
Sell now everithyng  while you can
Ayo, looks like ETH did some short liquidation RIP
after the sec the creators, which have 95% of the tokens will sell it all and leave all the xrp peasants holding a big bag of nothingness
volume is drying up. The uptrend is over, it doesn't have the strenght to make higher highs. Below the 20s within 4 days mark my words
so many eth maxi،¦s in the comments same old story, those gas fees on eth are terrible. Why waste the money? Sol actually works
BNB USD a stable coin just pass yall. 
Bearish for today, however overall bullish until the merge. I think we will see a big sell off mid-end of september as the bull run levels out and people reap their profits, however those who HODL will come out on top in the years to come.
Crash incomming ! Remmember 5 april 2022 and 6 juin 2022. And now 19 august 2022. The crypto market will fall cause its just maintained by scammer !
I think Ethereum is destined to hit sub 1k after this merge. That right there would be an opportunity of a lifetime.
best time to buy
if break 1k hold your pants 
No fud just truth. Bruh just wait until the merge. Shorting ETH will be the best move. since a buy the rumor and sell the news. what happens when matic hits 2$ again. Gas fees will be high. what happens when ETH chain gets so congested. fees will be high. merge is the worst 
i can't believe that there are people who still trust in this scam called Luna , don't expect anything from this coin ,if you have luna I'll be better if you sell it 
Have people forgotten that we are on the very brink of a recession happening or let alone at start of one? Meaning all forms of investments such as stocks, index funds, bonds and crypto are gonna be stagnate and very bearish for the next couple of quarters or years. There is a pretty decent chance this is a fake pump and is gonna return back to where it was in june. There is evidence that supports this in previous recessions (look at the 2008 economic collapse)
Predictable dip incoming.  It's boring watching the manipulation. 
This is not good. Institutions have no trust in ADA. Charles has to try to make deals in Africa. This is not working. People have lost a lot of money in this project. It䏭 really sad. 
$BTC and other coins will keep going down until the war ends. 
yall seen the ETH devs making fun of ETH staking. yeah I would short then maybe buy after the merge. 
in the first when i seen this green candle i knew that only pumbs
Definitely headed for 10 bucks.
kwon burn your 45% supply
is the worst chain. It uses the account model which is not scalable at all, it will be killed by ada soon
BTC  People will be mad salty when they realize this was a typical bear market rally and we are merely at the midway point of downward movement. Think logically. If the bear market is over, this will be historically the shortest, fastest bear market in history at a time when things have never been worse on the global stage. Limit the liquidity you provide for the manipulators and keep some dry powder on the side. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $SOL  $DOT  $DOGE  $QNT
hope its more bearish to buy 
it's time to left dot just sacmmer coin
nervos network will kill polkadot
not doing anything
Just think how many whales lose if btc goes down. Then you耱l understand the manipulation. 
this tech sucks. not buying at these prices or any price. don't invest in a centralized crap. decentralized will be key in the next bullrun.
is the next LUNA!!! SELL NOW before it goes to 0!! SCAM!!!
Not one coin moves unless bitcoin moves. Make it make sense. 
I just lost 100 dollars shorting،K it،¦s about time for rebound. Threw in 100$ For long. Hopefully I،¦ll make my 100 dollars back :)
Follow me and together we耱l watch bitcoin burn to the ground only to rise from the ashes like a phoenix. 
one if the worst POS chains in the game. why would anyone lock up 35 eth for 12 months. that's just crazy. I only see people doing this are the VCs and centralized exchanges. nothing will be fixed gas fees will be a problem, it's going to be centralized and censorship. AKA shit coin.
avax hack destroyed the trust ppl had on this blockchain. Cardano is the only layer 1 that is worth it in technical terms
nothing more than scam. The next Luna
isn’t growing it’s shit
BACK TO TOP
AZERO  Hard cringe always marketing this as "Solana Killer" or "Next $SOL ", "Missed Solana? Check out Azero!" .... lololol NOT!
keep dreaming of $1000 when it can't even reach it 2018 ath lol. ponzinomic just like terra
BTC  $ETH  $DOT  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE   Tesla(Elon) dumped 75% of his BTC worth of 936 million US Dollar. Why you say? Because they know the crash will come sooner or later.
WOO  'zero-fee' trading and unsustainable returns? This is sounding so much like $LUNC . Obvious scam.
made by corruption, SEC involved
stop say Sol is like Luna, Luna is a shit and Sol is a really project stop sell and buy
massive head/shoulders pattern on eth still not complete،K. based on previous crypto winter cycles as well as current TA my target entry point for eth is 500-600 range
down we go shorted this fake pump next 25$. it's to expensive to buy at these prices, wait for a bigger dump. 
Ignorant exchanges do such things to destroy ordinary people by taking money from weak people. Shame on these exchanges.
Come on Elon, I thought you had the midas touch, promoting this shitcoin, did as well as your fake rockets. Clown
ok bull session is done
next level 1327 if there is no liquidity we are going to 1130
don't go long btc dominance is going upside 
1500 doller eth afternoon sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell
how do I withdraw my profits? 
when stocks increase by 1 %, btc increases by 1% too. This is bearish and proves that investors do not trust bitcoin or market or both. I am not touching btc if it trades like stock. when recession hit, it will be hard-hit, harder than stocks
great depression is coming in 
if you care for your future financial situation please sell Solana, it's really easy to see it already failed
you can not withdraw after the merge for ETH staking 
CBX  is not decentralised, it is working for early investors only .. sharing critical insights to them .. classical example of inside trading. It was $TRX, then $CBX and now $USDT  .. CBX has 0 purpose and the goal of the team seems to entertain trade bots for leverage trading
is a food that makes you dream. Like Alice's Wonderland.
is the biggest scam. fair price of this s**t is 0.01$. Dont forget to check $CADINU
Avoid obscure and tricky projects
it's going dowwnnnnn :( glad I jumped ship at the first peak
I sold all my Luna !
to the moon! but this is a dead cat bounce, it will drop again. watch out
at the bear market peak we can expect to see 2 dollar DOT.  Sell immediately!
derish coin... not bad!
bad month for the crypto with massiv fakepumps鴂
pls pls crash to at least 700$. i want to buy at that price. 
pump & dump token
ETH & $BTC  play poker, see the true face soon.
I dont follow the "hype"...we wait
in a bit.. cross fingers
Great opportunity to short once again.
looks like hard dump
-BF2  I hope it will be a successful project going forward and always developing
fakeout. Dont get fooled
not been good so far
fake pump. still in the midst of crypto winter. going as low as 12k
The calm before the storm. The pump before the big dip. Eth whales are about to hunt FOMOers. Dont get trapped. Im out until ETH go down hard again
Solana is most likaly not going to flop like Luna did, its honestly just down cause the whole market is down and some minor issues going on right now. Your money is safe dont worry its not going to end up like Luna did.
$BRISE has much respect in the crypto world. Much respect from all the old gees $BTC $ETH $BNB and the likes of $SOL holders are now Brise holders as well. Moon is inevitable!
is going down, only one utility which is not unique at all, other chains does it better...after the sec trial it will go to 3 cents
the coming will be better 
Ok, it have a burn so what? Your money will burn faster here!
i would say it is a fake pump, be really careful. There is no reason for rising.
sell now and you rekt exchanges . waiting for the bottom 
memecoin is goin to zero
recession soon down to $700
i said it will go down, and they report me, so i losty other account, it will duuuuump we gonna touch the 1200$ 
is  fuking luna2 sell this sheet ind welcome to ADA 
The price keeps bouncing in a tiny range; it like watching ping pong. Amazing what robots can do these days!
dumping has begun. Dont invest for now. Dont let the whales win
needs to get a handle in outages! way overpriced with these ongoing issues! 
when this scam going to get out of the top 10?
the merge wont solve anything. High fees for everyone, let's rely 100% on matic....when we reach 400 million active users lets collapse together
hacked... go out so fast you can -> 0
3 bucks Is a buying point 
An avalanche of slime
scam coin banker coin ... you want some? ok enjoy the infinite supply. this is a coin that sold out !! garbage! censorship trash .. nothing good to say about it.. but because its been around for long people think its ok .. lol  dont lose your money!
if you have to choose between filling your gas tank or buying Avax, you know it is an easy choice 
bearish will come down to 19k-17k 
DOGE is a garbage coin it does nothing, it hasn・t accomplished anything, it・s sheer lunacy to invest in it.  Smart money is on MATIC Polygon. 
$BTC  Wait and see
down hard dude
DOGE  hit rock bottom and wavy just like $BTC   and 
WILL DUMP EXTREMLY !!! 
Attention Over 8000 wallet hacked will go to 1usd
Ethereum delaying the merge is a bad thing, investor confidence will decline, I have locked a part of $ETH   and hold more $RBIF   as it is expanding the platform to become a full ecosystem .
They drive the price up with hype and positive news knowing btc price is going to drop when FED hike the interest rate. Don脌 be fool. 
i think is the end of crypto 
send it to hell, bear signal was given. very clear. 1200-1300 price range is what I¡¦m looking for. potentially $800-$900 with FOMC and stock market FUD
calm before the storm :)
Btc has 2 top side... I think it will fall...So Eth does same movement
Lost trust, it's probably going to end similar to Luna. 
looks like more and more people got bored of waiting to grow more.... and slowly more and more is letting go from holding tight for the flight
i really don،¦t see any benefit of #ethereum other then that they have big comunity because they are from the first 20 ceypto platforms. with highest gass fees in crypto business i donmt see it going much higher. 
the war is coming
it’s going down day by day
Guys,let's put some stats when we try to make some predictions. Based on Dune Analytics, ETH price doubled in the past two months,While newly added smart contracts were less than 300K in the past two months(It's 2.7M the same time period last year).Besides, the Gas is around 6Gwei now. All of them showed a weak on-chain activities, how can we expect a pump in a short time ? Begin DCA on the neckline is a good strategy.It's around 1800 now
so glad I got out at the high. moved on
There's plenty upcoming world event that gonna effect bitcoin price  The fed next meeting $ETH   Marge ISO 20022 World Cup   this is gonna be bearish season boyss !!
failed to stay above the 24K resistance. We will probably look for liquidity void (green) with support at 21700.
Risk warning: The price of this token is subject to high volatility. Please understand the risks involved and trade with caution. Binance will not be held responsible for any trading losses. 
buterium is dead, long live torn
If you are buying now like I mentioned before, y'all going to get fckd in the a$$ without lube. DACing is the way! Sub 500 bucks incoming after merge.
Get wrecked Solana 
The most used blockchain and increasing while all others are declining. 
when everyone is bearish u will know it hit the bottom so i did not hit bottom yet it has some dipping to do imo 
640 is waving and stop listening to those who just want the market to move how they want it because it is what it is and it wont move according to what incognito says
i love bullmarket but i can see bearmarket still here and it's still going and more dips coming
Very bullish until the day before the merge. Bearish after. I will be selling 60% of my coins right before.   Not sure if good idea or not but will make a profit either way
I don’t know if anyone else can tell what the charts are saying…. Bottom is Gonna be Extremely ROUGH!!!!!
Dode has 8b market cap and Syscoin is at 100m ? crypto is a joke i swear
-MOST URGENT BTC is crashing to 18k tonite. Tesla sold remaining BTCs.
LUNA is a dead scam coin that scammed a bunch of useless Luna maxi got rugged bc they thought $LUNA is a "investment" I'm glad they lost everything. they deserve it. now go buy the real projects like $ADA $BTC $ETH $XRP buy these coins and hold and stake. ETH bridge to ADA NFT
why etherum going down?
1 .5k too 1 .7k best short of my life in this bear market. 
ETH tanked, Volume is low, stocks will go down, so 
Project for 5 years prospects. There will be no rapid growth and do not wait.
bnb bearish go $20k soon ..I..
DEIP  $DOT  $SOL  accumulate for next bull run thank me later ;)
Yeah its crashing!
The current rally in crypto will expire in the coming weeks. The economy will not have a soft landing so this bear market will stay with us for the foreseeable future. Remember we are not at the peak of inflation yet. $ETH  $USDC  $ADA  $SOL  $DOT  $MATIC  $BTC
Correction isn't over yet, still waiting until we hit below 7k by autumn.
say no more Luna
elon musk has abandoned this coin
and down we go 
Bear flag broken, perfect retest to 21.7k, before the plunge down at next 100 points FED rate hike. Epic play !
BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $XRP  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE  $DOT  $SHIB   ANOTHER CRASH!!!!!! HALLALUIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
selling 1 billion forward for .29
Gary Gensler statement today confirms that SEC have this case won. This security is heading to zero unfortunately.
18000$ remove your money from market 
Im out and waiting for late next week to buy back.
AHF  FOR EVERYONE THAT LOST AND CANT SELL COME JOIN THE $LUNAT  COMMUNITY AND GET 4% REWARDS AND HELP BURN $LUNC  JUST BY HOLDING $LUNAT
$BTC  Sell now before the whales dump. Dont FOMO and wait
𩤃 Nothing changes, more elements indicate that we have not emerged from an unstable and risky zone..
fake pump, drop soon
I believe till things calm down and a solid plan and market is strong this will rise and drop slowly 
Avoid obscure and tricky projects
Crypto seems to be a scam, just make rich become richer. Never invest more than 1 usd on crypto again.
everything about luna or lunc or whatever is going on is wrong. it was a scam that went too far and ended in a majestic rugpull. people should move on, no need for new products from something that allready burned you. i lost a lot of money on that bs...
This coin should not exist. Maybe one of the biggest ponzi scheme  in crypto world. I'm sorry for people trust money. !
this crap is nothing more than a pump n dump scheme now 
this badly designed chain will leave the top 10 in the next few months. It's becoming irrelevant due to its flaws
This shitcoin should be trading below a dollar   
damn you ready to fall?  huge one is coming
scam coin the next luna, will drop to 1 usd someday
hurry and catch that falling knife! did you hear about the class action suit?
chart looks similar to may16th, big drop today to 26k
just a shitcoin
Don't listen to the xrp YouTube whales.  They bought to high and now want their money back by letting you invest.
KNC moon, this in shit :
not really concerned i bought first coins about 2 years ago dca every month and hodl untill such time as i am ready to sell but i feel a bit bearish at moment becsuse of fluctuation in price but long term who knows whats going to happen slow and steady wins the race 
crash again, touch 35 tmrw
DAG makes all other layer 1 platforms obsolete including eth. DAG will most likely flip ETH once the masses all discover this platform and start building on it. 
scam pump get out now
get ready for the bear in next week.
elon saying a sunrise that a Solana in spain language
still want POS? Still want staking ETH? and getting 2 Years blocked for 5% more ETH per Annum? Dumbshit!!!
wait you can buy Eth at 800 to 1000 usd after some days
avax is close to dissapear
The market in 2022 will be similar to that in 2018. After the twin peaks, it will continue to fall, and it will fall by more than 7 times (similar to 2018 to March 2020), and it will continue the bear market for 1-2 years.  After that, the market rebounded like crazy.
Back under .50 you go,  trash coin!
i fear an insane dump is coming..
will be dropping, alot of bearish confirmation. Opportunity for smart investors to buy low.
according to my TA this is going to $2.  Sell now and buy back later w dry powder.
Are you ready for the new fall like terra luna?
know I have some cent in my wallet
anyone still buying this deserves to lose your money. I tried warning yall back in March that do Kwon was being shady and look what happened. Now yesterday in his interview with coinage he basically admitted he rugpulled everyone, and that he's sorry. 鴂鴂
Scam that the founder was involved in
Avoid obscure and tricky projects
BTC  $ETH  What we are not realising is that btc has lost A LOT of value, we are all saying it will go to 29k but isn't the case here, 29k is now 24k, like we can see ETH is back to where it was in May so is the S&P 500.
Stop crying you fomo loving fools.Stop the fud, stop the scam , stop the crypto is going to 0. we been thru this 3x now and crypto been around 12 yrs we not going no where. SOLANA at $30 is a blessing when it،¦s gonna be worth hundreds or more during next bull run. Thank You
can someone please explain me what is the IQ of all you which invested in this crap? Lower than the average temperature in Siberia?
I don't know how anyone will trust this after what they did. don't tell me about the Devs they don't deserve any forgiveness 
Oh no! Fake pump all along!
Projects like Avax are bad for crypto's reputation in general. So fkn bearish.
he current rally in crypto will expire in the coming weeks. The economy will not have a soft landing so this bear market will stay with us for the foreseeable future. Remember we are not at the peak of inflation yet. $ETH  $USDC  $ADA  $SOL  $DOT  $MATIC  $BTC
new lower lows are incoming!
Once the Merge is release you will see $ETH price just drop and it is all to do with human emotion. People buy when the news is out and when the merge happens people will revise the priced didn't put and sell. Don't get me wrong $ETH massive potential in the future.
This shit is dead get real!
Inevitable crash as debt market unwinds. Thank you Mr Powell for laying the groundwork for the buying opportunity of a lifetime.
goes down to 8000,  why I wouldn't be surprised?  I even see eth going to 650 dollars
No max supply, it can be the next luna
invest in anything other then a shitcoin..
polkadot is one of those top 10 wannabe
That's my situation: filling my bags with Luna (classic) and waiting for the fork (plus I'm not going to buy not even a single new Luna). Moreover, I was thinking about a way to burn luna (maybe an NFT collection just like Shib???).
are we on bottom or we hit for 10k $USD ?
I heard need to sell all Luna
Going down for sure. Buy at 35 hopefully
Buy moon and go to hell 
is losing the sec trial, check discord
damn what a blood bath
is about to become an Altcoin lol ETHw  made me laugh soooo hard! its like using aid wheelies on a 40 year old man's bike. Very late to the PoS party imo.
classic bull trap 
solana shutchain is losing adoption by the second. Whales wanna pump it to get out. It will fall in short
people saying bullish are saying for in a months or 3 time. yes it will be bullish right now it،¦s bearish. or even mid way both going sideways really. before purest of bull. MAYB
why did people buy this?
the bottom will be in November/December in my opinion, after the mod term elections. lets see
well done killing off the GPU mining community...
Leave the platforms, stop trading, withdraw your money to the wallet, the platforms rob you, do not buy any currency
never catch falling knife
why going down day by day ???????
if this pump is real  $ETH  will keep going and I¡¦ll buy when it¡¦s real. manipulation at its finest in crypto and it sucks. 
crypto leaks is not fake or being paid by icp, if you believe that then prove it with evidence besides "they wrote about them". If you can believe Arkham's icp report, why not CL? oh right, because of your bags, makes sense
i'm close market... and big dump is coming
shit going down. stupid people still hope. all crypto is sbout to collapse in close future.
SEC will investigate their practices, stay away
You all ready for the drop. I just bought a month supply of instant ramen for me and my kids and I suggest you do too.
worse crypto chain and idea but sadly hugely supported by many rich people, and chain crashes all the time 
pos will be the downfall of eth.
So much to see and so little time to be. 
i have tell you guys this coin is dead is a scam do not you save earned moey in this shitcoin rug pull and goes to zero dead coin after merge it will ambush you rt zero dead shit
All markets crashing. Expect the same for BTC.
Eth merge will fail. 
yahh nge dump again
a bad week for crypto, bonds and stocks.
may drop a leg down
had to go to therapy over the fact I live in a world of morons and idiots who buy into the same very exact fing thing that took people's money in the first place. You holders should look up the definition of insanity. 
always shit and dead luna future soon
Everyone who holds crypto brace yourself for dump.
the sad reality is that the whales are trading promises for profit. this is how the Bitcoin scam works, they tell you to buy and hold in the promise that the coin gonna pump, and at this lower levels, the do series of small pumps and whenever the ...
AUG-SEPT 10K!  Be Patient
I just knew its going down XD but no one believed me and my comment was even removed XD. gonna go around 900
due to inflation is still existing.
poor code contributions to the repos, no extra value added, this coin will fall
slowly leaving top 10, as it should be
Need to go lower. Fake pump since 2 days. We are still in bearmarket
Vatalik Buterin "JP Morgan helped me create an unregistered security. Then we took 70% for ourselves before offering it to the market" Like i Said ETH is a censorship and centralized protocol. 
bull trap, 12K soon 
peoples are just waiting for the sec case to be over so they can sell after the pump....this coin has no utility and it will fall after that event
scam going to zero
trash. held for 1 year. kept buying the DIP and avg down. still losing money. finally got rid of this shit.
BNB will gain on $ETH as it falls from loss of hashrate/hardware/value due to PoS . your gonna get what you asked for . it will destroy crypto for the next  2 years minimum 
yet another dead cat bounce in a recession bound economy, bear market has not magically disappeared, downtrend continues.
support at 20,100.  only a matter of time before it weakens and breaks.  look for 18,500 short term and 12,000 in 6 weeks.  
Seems like it follows the Dow Jones IA pretty close
going lower. short time 
Mine and sell
centralized trash, whales will take profit
this coin is so over hyped 
I told you, dump was waiting until today. 
Garbage Solana will fall soon
LUNC I  Hope Noob dont think its going to 1$ or 0.01 $, I Hope noob of #LUNC dont going to $SHIB  army . STAY FOCUS on $BTC  or $ETH 
my little brother (incogneto) is providing you false info about ETH staking. Lido only gives you 3% apy also its locked up!!! the only way to collect awards/unstake is when other upgrade happens and that's not until 6 too 12 months. 
Nothing of significance or relevance being built on ADA. Besides retail hodlers on r/cryptocurrencies, no one talks about ADA. This is easily the most overhyped coin in the top 10. Days are limited.
is not going anywhere. load up at Twenty-free and below. 
The fact BTC is Bearish. 
is a shit coin ran by a bunch of satan worshippers 
trap , Fed rise 75 unit Inflation rate and till 18 months later market is 𣸮 bearish Bitcoin decrease till 12k 
It has no value, no utility, no future, no underlining service, but maybe it can only serve the name of LUNA which now stand as an ugly Meme Coin represent a vague unreliable project made by arrogant person.
will be killed by nervos network in the field of interoperability
the cancer of crypto
this is about to get much worse before it gets better
it،¦s going down for real this time 
Now will go down! Mark my words. 
1450 new support target evening time 
I read that LFG bought 100 million dollars worth. I would worry they dump it to revive the UDT ecosystem or LUNA. They are not tie together but they are invested in each other, you can read yourself on Do Kwon twitter on 4/7/22.
fake pump will dump soon
TRX.. Please wake up!
will drop further in the next couple months, but long-term will appreciate, regardless of the outcome with the SEC. Too much global adoption already. Short-term bearish, long-term bullish.
has too much supply can not go much higher 
BNB  $BTC  $ETH  $FTM  $AVAX  $SOL  $MATIC  Yall gotta be happy now, I hope the prices go down to All time low - stop complaining, buy when the price crashes even more. DCA - see the big picture, remember to zoom out when you have fear or doubts. Next year you'll be rich.
Down to 100 USD in quarter of a year after merge, mark my words...
is the next LUNA. It's just scam!
Avoid obscure and tricky projects
distribution zone, dump is coming. 
keep going down, who else has money aside and hopes to buy in the hundreds?
ok, i m out #short
buying when it comes back to 0.004
going down tonigh , dolar index is up , us stock market isn't holding
Fake rumors are being spread across multiple platforms that a MEGA ETH whale is in the market. This is simply not true and the current market sentiment is bearish.
Its dead already. I give up.. 
it's running out of gas ,, the rocket has fall down 
LOL fake pump 
i Hope more chances to buy cheap btc over dollar cost averaging will come soon 貫衅
maybe, just maybe the team behind this project solve all problems, but centralization (maybe some day). But I think now is overvaluated (just an opinion).
Bearish short term but longer term Solana will break ATH without doubts. DYOR.
partnered with world economic forum. Ok I联 out.
remember what I said about being bearish? called it bros
big Scam they steal our money and dump on us
with USDD growing Justin can dump his $TRX 
is still no 2 in nfts second to $eth SOL will grow alot in future !
If it's reversal to the upside, it's wouldn't be so obvious. You see whales did a BIG pump last few days ago, they know it's going to make many think BOTTOM IS IN !! And that's when they start distributing more to retailers. BTC by Dec to Q2, 8k to 12k range. Bear macro too great. Inflation too high still. If real reversal, it wouldn't be so obvious. Imagine they distributing now in anticipation of 100points hike on 22 Sep, that would be epic crash 
Too young, gonna crash, dont say you werent warned
will fall after the sec case, there will be a massive sell off, if you check the code it has many issues to scale properly
lost the trust, its not decentralised anymore
ethereum is crashing
im long at 1150
dead cat bounce.
just don't. like I said ETH will hit 900$ just wait. 
markets going to zero
Probably gonna dip below the dip from July. Around 800 ish in Oktober - November. Beginning of 2023 the rise will start again.
i hate you ripple labs. so i buy more #xrp because i am an idiot. 
Fake Pump people getting salary in the next 3 days... nothing positive in the next coming up weeks :( In at least 20 days 10% down again $BTC $ETH $BNB $XRP $ADA $SOL $DOGE $DOT $LUNC $LUNA 
No fundamentals have changed since the last dip. Don't fall in the bull trap.
keep your cash until 14k
only way they need safe Luna classic other ways all crypto goin to zero they need help Luna no one goin trust crypto again this guys have billion dolar they are useless
is it gonna go down than $30
i thing it will not increse for now
everything above 1$ is overpriced.
Is scary to see ETH dipping southwards،K. Hope it recovers gradually soon. 
here comes the china-taiwan tension watch out guys
we will see Bitcoin Landing on $20,000
Solana is down again, had an outage for 18 minutes...freaking unreliable....
SHIT COIN, SELL THIS SCAM
always was and always will be a shit coin!
i sold @1350 wait another dip 1000 to buy again 
still have any doubts it down back to 800-1000$ next days? ok, let's see :)
the last dance gonna be under 8$..be patient...the bears are hungry and angry...
book profit and sell now selling this crypto 
Shockwave: The Next Phase Of Secret Network،¦s Explosive GrowthSECRET ANNOUNC
Get ready for Dump guys!Bull trap accomplished!
dead cat bounce it is.
haha, bearish on Bitcoin. I agree with the rest, the price will go lower. 
So glad the price is dropping. Definitely overpriced. 
The fact BTC is Bearish. 
THE CPI REPORT IS 9.1%. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON簛 UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS, THIS IS FREEFALL TIME. HISTORICALLY HIGH INFLATION MEANS THE ALGOS ARE DUMPING THE MARKET RIGHT NOW
if you think the mErGe will send ETH to the moon, you are delusional. Dump now or be dumped on by fat-pocketed VCs.
back to 1 .5k ?! then buy again too short ?! or dump more ?! 
everyone hyping this up because it 𢛴illed a zero but it䏭 still worth nothing and those expectations from all the guys who bought it at 80 dollar and just spreading false information so y緔ll buy is actually pretty cringe. 𠶧o the moon, when lambo retards ong
am still bearish on BNB bcus I bought at 450$ b4 the general crypto  crash and coming up gradually now. I hope it gets to #1000$ soon.
people who keep saying going up in bear market XD
This manipulation will eventually end. 
fake pump huge dump soon
will break new ATH's very soon! so much coming LFG!!
Selling all my AVAX now and buying back at 22. The correction is coming and will be harsh.
Has to attack superior tech to keep them down. The superior tech will win no matter what. AVAX is a shitcoin.
I love #Bitcoin as much as the rest of you guys but Bitcoin is not a Hedge against inflation it is nothing more than a speculative asset just like stocks,precious metals, or any other speculative asset its nothing more than that no matter what these dumbass Bitcoin maxis say
lol shit coin...
next crash solana, avax and xrp, so sad!
just put this shitcoin out of its misery. another exploit.
This is such a notable and uncommon project!
18700 coming I think  18700 is bottom
worst blockchain, it can't scale, insecure...doomed to failure
merge flop merge flop merge flop !!! sell this worstless "coins" it's going to be a security then sec will blame crypto for being a scam. merge flop!!! lmaooo dumb monkeys going to get rugged soon. bahahaha !!!
if you zoom out to monthly, you can see eth did almost the same in 2018 from april to may what it did now from july to august. I personally expecting a further drop.  Stay safe and dyor
let's all boycott Luna
Warning that some wallets are being drained of $SOL tokens, what can be done to prevent this whilst waiting for a fix? Revoke app permissions from your Phantom wallet perhaps?
guys you wont see any pump in this years or in the next years , next pump will in 2024
THIS WILL FAIL A LOT BOYS
going down. Network fails every time,  look at the facts! Head and Shoulder will give us a nice short opportunity.
BTC  $ETH  $DOT  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE   Tesla(Elon) dumped 75% of his BTC worth of 936 million US Dollar. Why you say? Because they know the crash will come sooner or later.
That's what you get for having fast transactions, shit security. What a train wreck.
Like I said... look at the 1M/3M chart. It is NOT an uptrend. World economy is not recovered, war has not stopped, record inflation has not been solved, recession has not been solved...
slowest rugpull ever
sell invest it NEAR, AVAX, TELOS . Solana is done
this is way too funny to watch everyone having high hopes in a coin that is past dead. This absolute trash is already decayed and turned into dust and still people are saying it will hit 0,1 or 1
this project is kinda disappointing.
I think this one evidently will succeed!
still more to clear out before next big jump
sell it now before it،¦s a penny.  Learn from Luna.  Steady lads!!!!!!!
has failed to be adopted. The account model it uses didn't let it moon
GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL HAVE THE SHIRT ON YOUR BACK ! 
Brazil Cryptos.  hey guys. what䏭 your opinion on BTC trend for the near future ?  we think it䏭 bearish but who really knows what the future holds !?
Piece of shit coin.. The ceo dumps on all you guys, hes an egotisical maniac had many oportunities to settle with the SEC
