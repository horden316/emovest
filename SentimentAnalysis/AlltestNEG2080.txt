only payed 2000 but will sell in a few years to get some cash back offc
got liquidated at exactly 1695. what kind of shut manipulation is this crap
keep your cash until 14k
The fear is dominating all markets. May the fear overweight the hope before the upcoming Merge? Can't rull out this scenario
it will down gaian to 27k
BTC $ETH $ADA $SOL $LUNA all cryptos are controlled by Tether covered by some exchanges like FTX they want your cryptos value to go down so they don't pay you back the same amount you paid on your way in. they can mint as much USDT and crash any coin
after the hack ppl lost trust in this
Excellent Keep up the good work.
Never buy eth again ist scam for whales loser Coin better Look other Coin! vitalik is loser!! daemon!!!
going to 11k or even lower over next few months�� if you think otherwise you�胩e being decisive �� screen shot this
party will end soon
Why solana is Not taking its Block chain seriously????????
Has everyone been fooled? Is Charles a snake oil salesman? There is no large whale money , or institutional money feeding ADA. It䏭 a lot of shrimp money. Do we really think that an upgrade (Vasil) will make ADA $1. I don think so. I think you are all being played . 
The market manipulation is real out here ;(
sold out of $DOT  for more $STX
Soon will dump. Be Careful 
will dissapear after ada implements avax virtual machines
starting to lose faith in ADA it just doesn't deliver or hold up its price like ETH, SOL, or FTM. Still waiiiiiiiiiiiting for it to pop. Even when everything else was making crazy highs, it barely pumped.
This is the reason entire Crypto  dustry will get tightly regulated much sooner than anticipated here in the US. much needed also. Regulation= no rug pulls.
will be replaced by ada. The account model is not scalable to serve millions of users and the merge wont solve anything in terms of fees
not doing anything
will be the next Luna. Just saying
it䏭 about time to book some profits as the bulls getting weaker.
next Luna, so sad!
8 cent stable coin. Need I say more?
VC crap, not decentralized, going down, time incorrect, not secure, every SQL-Database works better،K Solana is one of the worst projects
will go down soon 𪊶
A retest of #1500 is on the card after Powell speech today.
lol bull babies do not like my stated facts because they don�脌 believe facts. Continue crying, there will be more tears come Sunday. No more milk for you. Drink water instead. 
sell it before you lose
1569$ after the merge then next few months will 1469$ after 12 months it will be around 800$ 
centralized. This is account based, non scalable, I keep warning about this. Solana will not make it. Stick to ada
fools have taken over the market big burns coming 
sinking like I said a week ago ;)
if break 1k hold your pants 
$CELO is absolutely bullish but $CCD is a beast at the moment.
Stop crying you fomo loving fools.Stop the fud, stop the scam , stop the crypto is going to 0. we been thru this 3x now and crypto been around 12 yrs we not going no where. SOLANA at $30 is a blessing when it،¦s gonna be worth hundreds or more during next bull run. Thank You
i hate you ripple labs. so i buy more #xrp because i am an idiot. 
every day I wait for my $250 trigger to hit،K what is taking so long? thoughts?
this pump will not last, perhaps, a global economic shock is incoming ... Brace yourselves, folks!
we are not far away from Sunday. vol is usually half of what it is now. what effect that would have on the price? Go to bed and come back the next morning, you will ask yourself what just happened. 18k on the cards then 17k then a free fall. 
going to collapse one day suddenly
the bottom of price of this coin is unidentified yet, so it'll go lower. I am absolutely sure
I feel sorry for all the people that are still holding ADA. 
shit project wouldnt touch with a 10 foot pole.
It will take at least one years to reach its ATH price !
Idiots start crying when they start seeing an hour-day of dip. Just do daily trade if you are not looking at the bigger picture.
You guy should wait as charts show eth can go all the way down to 1400
Sell NOW or on the next available pump.. $22-$25 or less is coming for $SOL  soon! $NDQ (NASDAQ) is dropping off.. so $BTC  will follow.. $18K here we come!
Seems like it follows the Dow Jones IA pretty close
perfect time to open short position, fake pump, dump incoming. Back to 1000
BTC  -- $USTC   Now is the time to buy, the exchange hotbit price 0.0180 is very low, the best buy is 200% difference 100X soon $USDT   $USDC $FEG   $WBNB   $BUSD   $BTC $ADAUP   $SOL  L $LUNC
BTC  $ETH  $XRP  $MATIC  $SOL  $DOT  Dont invest you will for sure get caught in a bulltrap. Control your FOMO and save your money now and invest later.
Correction isn't over yet, still waiting until we hit below 7k by autumn.
Guys Better invest in BTC Eth is going to fail
You guys are so sensitive when you're met with the truth. I'd say thats a bit alarming. 
next luna down
Am I going to need to do anything with my eth coins once the merge happens? I'm hearing about a fork etc.
SEC will investigate their practices, stay away
the merge will be the last pump, we respect eth for being a 2nd generation and the creator of defi,  but it has no chance against a 3rd generation coin like Cardano
I am bearish about: $BTC  $ETH  $ADA  $LINK  $DOG
LUNA this project can't be revived, deal with it and be save
this project is totally useless. Nothing is happening on this chain. SELL NOW. 
Waiting, it needs a few more big red dildos until we see 12K
i was scam i don't know
i sold @1350 wait another dip 1000 to buy again 
get down to 1450
I think Ethereum is destined to hit sub 1k after this merge. That right there would be an opportunity of a lifetime.
sell invest it NEAR, AVAX, TELOS . Solana is done
some new gem will come but not 
pump hard dump harder 
Sell now and buy next month at -30% 
China and Taiwan and economy collapse incoming.
Are you ready for a big dump? ��� SELL NOW 
so today I will probably lose the BTC competition .  BTC is not moving to $ 26333.
Fake Pump people getting salary in the next 3 days... nothing positive in the next coming up weeks :( In at least 20 days 10% down again $BTC $ETH $BNB $XRP $ADA $SOL $DOGE $DOT $LUNC $LUNA 
bearish piece of shit
huge head and shoulders. buying sub .30
BNB will gain on $ETH as it falls from loss of hashrate/hardware/value due to PoS . your gonna get what you asked for . it will destroy crypto for the next  2 years minimum 
messy project!  according to an expert on crypto banter.  I suggest selling now!
becouse it's testing
The USDT-LUNA market will be removed on 06/03/2022. at bittrex  who have luna there sell and run .
fake pump this is a trap if u r buyed in low just sell it now and wait for big dip.
Sadly they let me down too many times
KDA pow can be only $BTC  why do you think rhat $ETH changed from pow to pos??
So many people here will lose all their monies.
I told you all that BTC is going down to hell and you耱l thought it a joke... Don脌 fall for the ant hill been made by whales these season
Many people are forgetting SOL is still in Beta. It's a good thing they are fixing the bugs now not later when it's in Production.
Defintely headed for a 1k.
CPI rally complete, dip beginning 9:30 Buckle up 
price is just a hype. A chain with a lot of stops and scaling problem only worth less than $5. Just be careful!
this crap is nothing more than a pump n dump scheme now 
will not survive another 6 months. It's Going down hard 
will get killed by $PLS
USDT ponzi coin backed by nothing, they can mint any amount of usdt but when redeeming they can keep you waiting till they crash the market $BTC $ETH $BNB $ADA $XRP $SOL 
price too infladed, posible drops
Ignorant exchanges do such things to destroy ordinary people by taking money from weak people. Shame on these exchanges.
As cheap as it could ever be right now. Lucky buying at these prices.
going down, down, down. $10.
bullish long term but the worst is yet to come.
i can taste that interest rate hike all ready.
Come on Elon, I thought you had the midas touch, promoting this shitcoin, did as well as your fake rockets. Clown
another day not to buy eth
CEL  is disappointing investors and they can only hope when joining this lending platform, I accept the risk to stake $ETH   and with that I also take the opportunity to staking $RBIF  , it's a lot less risky than 
A there are far better coins and tokens to invest in.. especially after how they left ppl in the dust when $LUNC and $USTC  collapsed.. I bet that lot of ppl invested in this just BCS of the low price and a hope that this too will moon like $LUNC did 
was a good project but know I dunno...
this is zionist coin... huge scam comin up soon!
A you get all rekt by do kwon again. real lunatics buy only $LUNC - the real terra luna. not this garbage coin. 
wow, I am worried, where do you think BTC will arrive?
By Dec to Q1 Q2, BTC will bleed to 13k to 8k range. If inflation does. It come down to minimum 4.5% or 5%, nothing will be bullish. Wait to invest, not now, not yet. Wait for Dec at least. Just a quick few months to get nest price.
If you like $SOL  you may like a index for the ecosystem, check $SOLI  is doing well!
I love Ethereum… it is the Future boys and girls!!!! But it is about to fall hard and take a BigShit!!!!!
9$ incoming. Giant head and shoulders. Blood in the streets for a rocky project that has dirty influence in the crypto space.
The Bears 𣸮 get a whole month in Septembear. What do the bulls get? besides burned. lmao  
this is a bull trap and manipulation. anyone that thinks is a reversal needs to do more learning.
i do not think it gouing to moon , price will change litbit but soon it will bearish 
big money outflow,succes distribution for retail
same as $LUNA just a few days
FOMO and FUD , the psychology trick used to whale advantage
huge gains in the market today. ADA isn脌 moving. Get ready for a huge sell off. 
scam, run boys run
will tank. Weak chain.
market capitalization of this coin is 623 million. value of the coin is currently 0.000095. to double this amount high someone has to deposit 623 millions at luna money and then the value rises to 0.00019 .and what fool is going to do that??
It is officially over for 
Wow, why r they having so many problems now?  Can they fix all of the bugs? Very sketchy, stay away, I feel terrible for all the ppl that bought in at $140+ 
has his own dollar busd , if busd goes down also bnb will go down. Same situation like luna ?Just asking for a friend :))))
BTC, ETH, MATIC all serve a need & accomplish things and earn money.  DOGE coin and other flim flam useless coins that have accomplished nothing will be outlawed soon and fall by the wayside. Fed・s are carving out crypto regulation laws now so be warned 
the crypto community needs to move away from $BTC it䏭 to controlled and centralized now !  before institutional money in game crypto was fun to be innow this Sh*t is ran by some rich dummies , who claim they will live on Mars one day 榀𩐳 
We want a slow climb.... not a pump and dump 
mad i couldn't buy $GMT  shoes last night at 2.5 SOL. stupid blockchain hault.   >:(
while the price of ETH is going down.. The price of GULF is going up..
Guys,let's put some stats when we try to make some predictions. Based on Dune Analytics, ETH price doubled in the past two months,While newly added smart contracts were less than 300K in the past two months(It's 2.7M the same time period last year).Besides, the Gas is around 6Gwei now. All of them showed a weak on-chain activities, how can we expect a pump in a short time ? Begin DCA on the neckline is a good strategy.It's around 1800 now
FED gonna talk in 10 min... They gonna pull out money that upholds house loans....
account based chain. Go for euxto chains, this is worthless long term
short term pump then more dump to 1000 or 900
is trash is not decentralized  they voted to take peoples coins away 
We wont see another bull run until etherium bottoms out at around 1200.
I have never been through any kind of bear market. I got involved in crypto in January of 2021. Ive never been through an actual relief rally because this bear market is so bad. Everything you learn in this bear market will help you so much when the next bull market starts.
A this is not the right Luna $LUNC 
damn you ready to fall?  huge one is coming
it،¦s crazy this thing still has a market cap. thank God for chains like Cardano that actually work! 
BTC $ETH another fake Bull, watch out!
dead coin, only alive because fake news said to invest on it
Just HOLD guys, it's a bear market, don't be a foolish investor and sell every thing you own
DAG makes all other layer 1 platforms obsolete including eth. DAG will most likely flip ETH once the masses all discover this platform and start building on it. 
A long way down to go yet. 
can the dip just happen already so we can move on and start a bull market. This bear market is getting very tiresome. 🙃
just cashed out sorry sol it was a good year
BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $XRP  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE   $DOT  $SHIB  WOW. The market seems to spike up for only a few moments only to crash down immediately. Who would have known? #FeedingTime  #BearMarket
merge flop merge flop merge flop !!! sell this worstless "coins" it's going to be a security then sec will blame crypto for being a scam. merge flop!!! lmaooo dumb monkeys going to get rugged soon. bahahaha !!!
Bull trap next week
Ethereum had limited supply, but now ETH has unlimited supply, be careful guys
is going for a major correction. Prepare for $1.5K ETH in the next 7 days. Though long term(years) I'm still bullish.
1 week go earth...$luna go dead today
needs to get a handle in outages! way overpriced with these ongoing issues! 
i think it will test the 4,85 USD resistance zone but i beleive it can go bullish in a further future because this is a greay project
I'm keep buying it, the more it dropes the more I will buy.
People who talk about shitcoin amaze me. Solana is a true technological innovation. It's a beta, it has bugs, it fixes them. I don't understand this FUD of the little haters who discover the world of crypto and who cry all the time.
The Videos are very likely real.  His statement against it was also vey weak.  Everything just fits too well together.  Its really sad to see and i also liked AVAX before that.  But this..... well i don't want to be involved into such a criminal project.  And as long as there are no real proofs that the videos are fake, i will keep my attitude.
Project for 5 years prospects. There will be no rapid growth and do not wait.
the best way to lose ur life savings
Appreciated I like the way you're working.
Climbed way too fast, even for Crypto standards. I think people are worried that they might miss out while it pumps.  Fed raising basis points and recession looming, people need funds to buy gas and food, etc.  I see a recalibration near $1000-$1100 in the next 10 days. 
buying and holding sol and sol nfts! 
Cardano will be out of the top 10 this year 
it's just a bubble Dot will go down to $3

time to buy...next bull run will reach 1000
The bearish scenario of the bitcoin this month only the time give us the right answer. 
fake it until you break it pump
every couple of days I come here just to check if there are still any fools left investing in this dead, abandoned scam coin..
no tokens on this
similar of jun 2022 it was price in 29k than bullish in 31k then bearish in 20k I联 thinking it䏭 game from 20k to 22 k then bearish in 15k at soon 
BTC  Bank runs have begun in China, depression has not yet been announced, and governments being overthrown worldwide. Expect more pain before the elites finally "reset" the global financial system. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $BNB  $DOT  $DOGE  $XLM  $XDC
Stand whith $BTC $ETH $DOGE $SHIB $BNB $XRP $ADA $MATIC $LTC
get ready for a selloff xD
slowly leaving top 10, as it should be
volume is drying up. The uptrend is over, it doesn't have the strenght to make higher highs. Below the 20s within 4 days mark my words
will pump again within 48 hours
the bears will take over
or any crypto sucks with too much volatality
Desirable It looks like you've put a lot of work into this.
Not one coin moves unless bitcoin moves. Make it make sense. 
definitely bearish as it is too overpriced. I would not recommend investing your all money to ETH. It is also weird that the price doubled itself in the bear market while there is no any significant reason. And last but not least, do invest in $ADA for long term returns :)
say no more Luna
The concept of XRP is outdated, there are multiple other coins that accomplish what XRP can do.  If it wasn for this prolonged lawsuit, nobody would be talking about XRP. 
Impossible to rise under the collapse and without the king, btc I don't care about the new update, fake flags for you to buy
im long at 1150
BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $XRP  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE   $DOT  $SHIB  WOW. The market seems to spike up for only a few moments only to crash down immediately. Who would have known? #FeedingTime  #BearMarket
the bears are back in town 𦅚𦅚𦅚
watching this dump is more enjoyable than watching a Biden speech. SELL
How easily they manipulate and steal our money
polkadot is one of those top 10 wannabe
SELL AND GO SHORT NOW , 2023/24 super bullish 
still going down 
Market Manipulation, Be careful the price Will drop soon!
noob developers running the project. They patch things up on the go, this is done. Stick to ada
BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $XRP  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE  $DOT  $SHIB   ANOTHER CRASH!!!!!! HALLALUIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your ROI completes in 20 days 
hahaha imagine trusting these clowns with a V2 to do it all over again! Goodbye to algorithmic. Let's stick to the stuff actually backed by USD.
Bullish for development, bearish for the price.
highly speculative project, promises a lot but nothing done. The founder has a huge ego, we have better projects on the market. 
Elon officially sees Doge as a simple meme and nothing more, and developers are too lazy to improve, giving the excuse that you don't change what's good. Don't be fooled by recent partnerships, they are either useless or over-promoted. Like, what % of the public buys tickets in Doge? Partnerships should grow the community, not add more echo-chamber material for the people already in it. I mean zoom out to 1y and 'all', it's going down. Without Elon's full backing it's not going up. Knowing Elon is sorting his Twitter mistake, he probably won't even look at Doge. If you're holding a big bag, man you do you.
going to 2 bucks mid term
 in here the whale doesn't want to buy a lot of bitcoins, some are waiting at the price of 12k 
slowly but surely solunavax will fall out of top 10. I feel like polkadot should be top 10 by now. polkadot hasn't shut off bc they used one of cardano white paper lmaooo man feels good not chasing moon boi coins/tokens/high yeild/staking thru rugg pull exchanges (Voyager). 
this coin destroyed an murdered people, if you support this coin, you are worst than hitla
Chinese woke up and sold the worst is over
A long way to go yet. 
FED... MTGOX...WAR... and this people its bullish. I dont undestand
Going into the shitter faster than a mexican at a bbq
Nothing of significance or relevance being built on ADA. Besides retail hodlers on r/cryptocurrencies, no one talks about ADA. This is easily the most overhyped coin in the top 10. Days are limited.
could never recover after the big hack they suffered. People should be wiser when investing
Market needs to be purified. I'm holding during this dump. Approx. 230 days left before end of Bear market. This lows was needed like rain in Africa. Only smartest and strongest will survive! That's the beauty of recession
there it is... and this time it'll go down hard. you know what to do, don't you? $USDC ... just saying. stop your losses. 
The panic has only just begun
people i don¡¦t understand why you don¡¦t do some research, the last beae cycle eth dropped 94% , do your calculations this bear market is more terrible then ever war , inflation the biggest, global economy in crisis, so 94% drop as the 2018 bear cycles means 200-400$ etherum 
Crypto going down is not a bad thing, 
sol was going good until i bought it and the next day the price drop
it's raining black swans
i didnt understand buying...
come on dump I dare ;)
failed to stay above the 24K resistance. We will probably look for liquidity void (green) with support at 21700.
The current situation, the price reduction will continue for some time.
is about to become an Altcoin lol ETHw  made me laugh soooo hard! its like using aid wheelies on a 40 year old man's bike. Very late to the PoS party imo.
pure manipulation 
is a guaranteed 6x-10x from it's current price! WHEN $BTC  hits a new ATH of $80K+ this year you will see a $400+ $SOL  Guaranteed!  BUY AS MUCH AS YOU CAN NOW! Don't get left behind with regrets because of FUD or current low price action! BiG MOVES coming the next 2 weeks!
It will go down day by day, the code is pretty bad and some software design decisions they made are built up into the core. That's not something you can refactor at this point. This project has failed and it's not scalable. When will it collapse? depends on how fast user amount grows. If Sol reaches active millions users in a couple of months you will see the end of Solana quicker than expected
Awesome I like the way you settle down to work.
passed the EMA 55 and Ichimoku Conversion Line Cross Base Line.MACD is crossed allready so bearish will follow
i Hope more chances to buy cheap btc over dollar cost averaging will come soon 貫衅
bad month for the crypto with massiv fakepumps鴂
Binance is a fraud because it is one of the biggest holders of Luna Classic. With a 200% pump, it was able to attract a lot of capital to itself.. Now you see the fall.  This is a game for adults
is getting in a big trial like ripple did, sell now
Don't let anyone fool yourselves, there is no chance of this coin rising again. This is seen as a scam, please don't get delusional and don't get your hopes up.
Lost trust, it's probably going to end similar to Luna. 
maybe, just maybe the team behind this project solve all problems, but centralization (maybe some day). But I think now is overvaluated (just an opinion).
$BRISE has much respect in the crypto world. Much respect from all the old gees $BTC $ETH $BNB and the likes of $SOL holders are now Brise holders as well. Moon is inevitable!
This coin is awful as transaction requires LOTS of gas fee. What's the point of using a crypto when its fee is ten times higher than a bank?
I think another accumulation phase is overdue.. as well as a retesting of previous lows, this would be a preference for many; to allow confidence in buying and to FOMO in some bullish movement! We shall see soon enough what BlackRock & The U.S. FED have in store for us..
too much gas fee
can't dump alone even stocks haven't responded to the inflation data.. Lets wait for 27th
going down. Network fails every time,  look at the facts! Head and Shoulder will give us a nice short opportunity.
bay and don't sell
will be a dead project after the merge. only 4% staking and 12 month lock up. ETH will the biggest rug. 
maybe going down for 1500 or 1400 and next we must be open the buy position
We gotta go deeper now... It's not time yet
not looking good.
not can go to the mooon💩
Elon Musks son wants to bea trans girl and have nothing to do with him. sounds like its time for another meme, maybe, ELONTRANS INU? Man, crypto is so gay
As for $SOL  I think it may soon be time or due for a signifcant market correction; to restest lower areas of $28-$30 or lower in $SOL .. This is necessary to catch the bigger buys and fill the HUGE shorts at those ranges; in order to boost profits and pump MCap in the longterm!
sorry kids, bullish sign is gone (short term) we are looking at btc between the ranges of 19k-21k. It䏭 very possible for this to change (FOMC meeting) could go to lows of 16k or upwards to $26k
fake pump take profits and out 
Now Time To Dump 
The CPI inflation rate is seen hitting 8.8%, though Deutsche Bank economists are predicting 9%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Everything what Ethereum have failed to deliver all those years, have $CSPR which is ETH v3.0 and $DOT already delivered and accomplished! 
The most used blockchain and increasing while all others are declining. 
had to go to therapy over the fact I live in a world of morons and idiots who buy into the same very exact fing thing that took people's money in the first place. You holders should look up the definition of insanity. 
Thousands of Wallets Attacked on Solana, Millions in USD Stolen (UPDATED)
Maybe after all the de-pegs, it's a sign to stop buying stable coins. Maybe dollar or any other irl currency in a crypto form wasn't a good idea after all.
its bear market, it's gonna crash down so much more
Bearish so incogneto the basement Dweller comments
what is support level for low. looking for another buy position
To Many hacker . Some $1.83 billion has been stolen from bridges to date, with the majority of that ($1.21 billion) taking place just this year, according to Elliptic. I dont Trust
going down like crazy, non tech people realized that the merge wont solve anything
sell me your tokens kids.
can someone please explain me what is the IQ of all you which invested in this crap? Lower than the average temperature in Siberia?
here comes the china-taiwan tension watch out guys
the bottom will be in November/December in my opinion, after the mod term elections. lets see
My fellow LUNC holders, as much as I would love to see this at $1, truth is this: (a) you are being mislead by PR machines like HCC which tries to keep your hope alive to make you hold and others invest more into LUNC BUT truth is and you feel it, you loose money on this coin if you look on the big picture (b) PR machines like HCC piggy back ride on your genuine hope that this will rise whilst they monetize you using Youtube, Twitter, NFT etc and so them are the winner not you (c) as you can notice terms when this is to go to moon is changed from August to September, then to December and so on. The minute you stop trusting this PR, the game is over. My opinion only!
Ninety-Nine percent of these coins will be worthless by the time the economy recovers. That won't happen until the start of the 2030's. Save what you can or loose it all.
DEAD CAT BOUNCE. BULL TRAP. By Dec or Q1 Q2, BTC will range btwn 12k to 8k and all alts will bleed out by then. Then that would be the bottom. Meanwhile STAY OUT !!! DO NOT FOMO in crypto. It's the fastest way to die.
time to good bye, thank you be a big part in crypto. 'The Merge' is the biggers mistake u have done. 
There is no reason why ETH goes up. Price pump is manipulated. The global  economy is at its worst like never before in past years.  ETH must easily dump under 1k and that from a very optimistic view.
BYE BYE ETH CRASH 
Developers making money out of announcements on twitter only to delay again each time they make millions while you poor people buy in to the hype. 
Contagion spreading like cancer. Soon forced liquidations. ETH $480, and BTC $8k to $12K, all by Q4. BRACE BRACE BRACE !!! Rtae hikes, housing foreclosures, etc. perfect financial storm
If i buy, it will be between 750-1000 dollar. The macro economic situation is pretty bad. If the FED increases de interest rate with 100 bp, the cost of borrowing will increase dramatically. And quantative tighting is failling. The FED is making a loss of 500 billion dollars this year, and the loss will be transferend to de federal State. The taxpayer is going to pay for saving the banks, the expensive cars etc.
interesting analysis for bottom. 
Everyone go and closed your tarfe Eth will big dumped coming first terget 1320 2nd 1000 3rd 880 
and $BTC  have no use as an actual currency. (if the united states dollar droped 80% in a year people would be in absolute panic). It is just built on hype. And with a real currency you dont need to pay $100 gas fees. Drop crypto and embrace stocks.
stay away from this satan coin they are partners with WEF the people causing al the problems in the world
PoW is the reason BTC cannot enter mass adoption. It's so primitive that even Visa & Mastercard better than it. Stakeholders wanted to implement a lightning network layer to improve Bitcoin's performance and scalability but $ETH offers much promise.
After the ETH merge ADA will lose half it's value
There is a good chance that Bitcoin will fault in the upcoming days
Hold tight guys Things are getting more Beefy 
new lower lows are incoming!
it will drop to $1470 so it can pump even harder again
no future coin
VLX  needs more reputable projects. Right now $SOL  has more funds and more projects. So, institutions do not see the need for Velas because it's just a copycat of Solana.
same volume But Price Getting Pump Dump Badly
The current rally in crypto will expire in the coming weeks. The economy will not have a soft landing so this bear market will stay with us for the foreseeable future. Remember we are not at the peak of inflation yet. $ETH  $USDC  $ADA  $SOL  $DOT  $MATIC  $BTC
Since Twitter going down Elon will most likely stop supporting dogecoin lol.
Wow most of the shitcoins are scamsshit
The Videos are very likely real.  His statement against it was also vey weak.  Everything just fits too well together.  Its really sad to see and i also liked AVAX before that.  But this..... well i don't want to be involved into such a criminal project.  And as long as there are no real proofs that the videos are fake, i will keep my attitude.
Dump solana.. make it go 0.
below 1000 by tmr morning . don،¦t get caught in this small pump 
merge will flop. stETH whatever ETH will be a security in the future then big dump on retail bc they are locked in lmaooo just wait for the dumping. 
 A lot of fake comments here for last months... 瘸nyway, this old luna token has 0 utility after the fall. It's now just a pump&dump trash.
take your profits now before whales take it from you
BTC will surely come to 22k....Market was in very good condition since last 27th September to 14 August 
Eth is going down it will little up and then it will go under 1000 usd and It's fake pump.. just for grab your money.. don't be fool just wait and buy under 1000 at original price.
as soon as input all my money in i hear about this hack
LUNA this project can't be revived, deal with it and be save
bull trap be careful guys FED announces were not so good and SP500 companies balance sheet were not so good too.. look at the graph.. sp500 will go down soon, BTC follow sp500 and crypto market follow 
use your brain for god sake,
BTC  $ETH  $DOT  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE   Tesla(Elon) dumped 75% of his BTC worth of 936 million US Dollar. Why you say? Because they know the crash will come sooner or later.
time to open your $SOL Long positions
will crash 25-30% more in the coming week(s). Will recover slowly after. Very slowly..
Who thinks Elon Musk will spark new bull run?
The last chance to save your money is crypto coins ....
trap , Fed rise 75 unit Inflation rate and till 18 months later market is 𣸮 bearish Bitcoin decrease till 12k 
$SOL   real price for centralized commercial blockchain ,  eth clone with less security , no scalable ,  no community , all hosted on amazon server ,   no utility = shitcoin for monkeys and centralized firm :  1
Creating bear flag till tomorrow possible target is 1458.. 1350.. 1250 easily  
it can keep going up in the bear market. it¡¦s not over. short it 
all those who were bullish, nice hopium u had. literally can't sit down with the straight facts we threw right on ur face. Bears will win this market cycle.
could never recover after the big hack they suffered. People should be wiser when investing
$BTC  $ETH  $USDT  Dumb sol now or be sorry
Be prepared for the next big dip! 
i really love the astheitc of this token its beautiful i jjust wish there was a reason to invest in it
you can not withdraw after the merge for ETH staking 
has failed to be adopted. The account model it uses didn't let it moon
-BF2  I hope it will be a successful project going forward and always developing
btc isn't winning. just the euro's loosing
probably last pump before biggest dump. There is literally no reason for a pump. Its all manipulation.
Be Careful to Buy over 17..
You would have to be "special" to fall for the same scam twice...
As a new day trader its nice to see some chats. I cant find a souk irl that knows about crypto. is there any irl friends to be made. People are oblivious to crytpo
$ETH  $USDT   The current rise is just some false and unconfirmed news. There is no good news. The bookmaker has taken advantage of this. The price should fall and some bad funds should be cleared out, so that eth can better meet the rise! 1. Inflation. 2. U.S. dollar rate hike
Go learn economics. You'll see why this time it's different.
Are you ready for the new fall like terra luna?
Another signal for bear. 
elon saying a sunrise that a Solana in spain language
patiently waiting for the Worlds Best crypto to fall another 50% in Market cap before I start to DCA! DYOR!
We are close to one of the biggest crises in history. The energy crisis this winter will be devastating for Europe. The US that led the world for decades is now a country without a future and China is against bitcoin.
: ETH will go up again, if the macro conditions will improve. See it form this perspective: ETH had al ATH price of 4750 dollars. If you buy ETH at 1400 dollars, it is possible that the price could drop by 50% to 700 dollars, but in a bullmarket it will increase tot at least 5000 dollars, an 350% rise in price. This is a low risk, high benefit position. Buy small, do not go in, all at once.
fed soon. bearish.
crashing to 500$ than it will be  worth to buy :)
the biggest shiity POS will be ETH and a rug will happen.
going down to .38. then time to buy more.
Shocker, I am still bearish about $BTC  $ETH  $ADA  $LINK  $DOG
fake pump or real sign? 
the FED is going to hike up the rates and already provided hint to counter inflation. massive sell off end of this week to next week. if it happens we could see another few k drop. get ready for some amazing payout from the moon hodlers. 
short tron, ponzi like luna
I think BTC will still massively fall despite the fact that it’s growing on a slow rate.
Selling all my AVAX now and buying back at 22. The correction is coming and will be harsh.
let's all boycott Luna
yahh nge dump again
the goc ban ethereum
 cardano holders are so arrogant.  That they cannot download a cardano browser wallet and test a dapps like minswamp.  Where you get 10k btc for 1 ada. they are absolute blind to reality. haha but it is FUD hahahaha
dont get fooled
bullish within next month
sell now or cry later,, 100% scam
i am back from a month brake of crypto currencies and it is still the same i might take a longer one lol
Lil bro said rip in advance 
centralized blockchain with R.Freedman a law firm as a partner to attack all the other blockchains by submarine.  LOOK on the site cryptoleaks point info .   Do not support this blockchain, and share all this information .  Don't buy this s****
Why is Solana dumping so hard y'all? Any thoughts? 
who's bearish on $ETH like this post and show other people too
Go go go $SOL   i believed you can to the Moon
fake pump. Will go back to .04
is inflationary so much supply there will be more xrp in the market and it will drop more
CONFIRMED: Eth 2 now delayed till 2024. Buterin expects a fallIng knife dump to $500 . CARE 
ETH so if you post $0xBTC or $USDT  $SOL  any post on any currency post and it will post on all the other market posts???
bug brings down Solana. Again،K
centralised shittttt !! It،¦s the grandpa of Luna coin as well. Get out ASAP & thank me later. 
is a shit coin ran by a bunch of satan worshippers 
I think they will push back the merger. Just fomo, they will do it when it's a bull market.
Attention Over 8000 wallet hacked will go to 1usd
fcuk all the cryptos and their developers what a nightmire
I just don¡¦t like Joseph Lubin 
old technology. New advanced and improved L1 blockchain technology on it's way and that's Pulsechain. A hard fork of Ethereum with a copy of the full system state. The biggest airdrop in crypto space. All the ERC20 in your wallet you get a exact copy on Pulsechain. I expect the Pulsechain launch within 7 months.
WE ON A RECESSION!!
lower lows coming
BTC  $ETH  $XRP  $MATIC  $SOL  $DOT  Dont invest you will for sure get caught in a bulltrap. Control your FOMO and save your money now and invest later.
this shitcoin has 200 days at the most before the big downward spiral to the crypto graveyard

HUGE PROFITS WITH ORN
. Hello LUNA.. Are you ok?
I believe will pop between December and February just stacking my bags
and down we go 
all time low iis coming
I¡¦m bearish on$ETH 
I read that LFG bought 100 million dollars worth. I would worry they dump it to revive the UDT ecosystem or LUNA. They are not tie together but they are invested in each other, you can read yourself on Do Kwon twitter on 4/7/22.
No soul left!!
Slow rug pull.
TRX.. Please wake up!
has too much supply can not go much higher 
will go down with PoS, ETC will go up cause PoW is better than PoS
cpi index smashing us hard today
Crypto seems to be a scam, just make rich become richer. Never invest more than 1 usd on crypto again.
huge head and shoulders. I联 definitely buying sub .30
It's Luna all over again
go to the moon buy the dip lets go
This is not blockchain, it is scammers Chain . Never invest a single penny on this garbage.

Nice pump again, then rugpull..
I found a lot of coins better than ada in my opinion that's my right to say it!
never listen show men like Elon
ETH $BTC $ADA $SOL $AVAX $MATIC $NEAR $LINK $DOT lets go don't miss this little short term bullish movement we are going to have in a few hours. ready to long your positions
guys you wont see any pump in this years or in the next years , next pump will in 2024
merge will be a failure. Can't wait. 
Fair price at 7 cents 
$BTC $ETH time to short?
$BTC  for sure whales load their bags, but whales are an endangered species
the dropped is here, falling to about 14000
fake pump
lost a lot of money because of this shitcoin
trx will die soon
crypto leaks is not fake or being paid by icp, if you believe that then prove it with evidence besides "they wrote about them". If you can believe Arkham's icp report, why not CL? oh right, because of your bags, makes sense
LOL. Moons and rocket�䏭 now till the feds raise interest rates on September 21. Vasil upgrade on September 22? Ouch. That is some really bad decision making. 
sold all my eth 2 days ago. Not trying to play waiting game to reach max. profit. Now I just wanna buy more eth.. when has there ever been a moonshot without a falling shortly after
down to 1710 again and go straight before ultra dump with 2.0 ver
worst blockchain, it can't scale, insecure...doomed to failure
BTC $ETH $XRP garbage, buy it if you support the WEF!
short from here for 1500
dont get tempted by the pump you will regret buying at this price, wait for next 2 - 3 months to bottom then buy
very big sale coming over 400M  tight your belt well
Next Luna ... safe your money and invest it in better projects. 
what did i tell u lol. The volume is decreasing everyday. That means that the pump was only fomo and now that the hype is gone it will dump everyday
is not going anywhere. load up at Twenty-free and below. 
has good future but hackers are gonna sell more and price gonna go more down. sell asap
I didbt expect this bearish outcome for now at all 
it's going dowwnnnnn :( glad I jumped ship at the first peak
Down the toilet. Expect 7k in 2 months.
looks at my house no
market kicked me out thank you #btc 
My price prediction is $10 by end of year. Time to short it.
the sad reality is that the whales are trading promises for profit. this is how the Bitcoin scam works, they tell you to buy and hold in the promise that the coin gonna pump, and at this lower levels, the do series of small pumps and whenever the ...
screw do kwon and this crap coin. he abandoned all investors by abandoning terra classic. want to get even for his rug pull cam? buy lunc instead
is going down to 140$ to 220$ levels like in 2020. After 2020 plandemic and low interest rate people invested in crypto. Increasing inflation and interest means going back to 2020 prices. That's the bubble and will explode like Luna.
I'm hoping they turn it around.
I'm more bullish on ada, eth uses the account model, I don't see it bulling long term
It's a completely fake pump. .Only for the liquidity of shorts. This means that no one will buy now, if they buy, they will be stacked.
hacked... go out so fast you can -> 0
$USDD say good bye to your money!! Ponzi, scam , shit coin
BEARMARKET IS REAL SELL NOW OR SUFFER 10K INCOMING!!
LUNA  Bitconnect ver2. Don't trust this clown again guys. The crypto world needs to be build on solidated projects such $DOT  $AVAX
I hope this project dies completly soon
people are starting to see that ethereum can only grow up to a certain numbers of users before collapsing in fees and in overload due to the account model and the fact that it couldn't solve the trilemma. It had the hash power and for nonsensical reasons it switched to proof of stake, now it cannot compete with ada at all
people who keep saying going up in bear market XD
120 % increase in supply from start of 2021 ( 120 mill) until now 290 mill… that is one of the most inflammatory coin ever !
I Lost again with this
I have a feeling we are going to see some more down side till we get the upside
so many eth maxi،¦s in the comments same old story, those gas fees on eth are terrible. Why waste the money? Sol actually works
MT GOX INCOMING, MY PREDICTION BITCOIN DOWN IN 15K - 16K
buying when it comes back to 0.004
Without realizing it, we have fallen into the trap of a superpower country that is in need of large funds to support Ukraine
will go down to 800$ easily before to the moon. 
think it may soon be time for a signifcant market correction; to restest lower areas of $30 or lower in $SOL  .. This is necessary to catch the bigger buys and fill shorts in order to boost profits and MCap in the longterm!
waiting for the juicy dip
I believe market will go sideways until Q4 2022
i think it is going under 15k
Fed News by Next Week. Bullish.
with USDD growing Justin can dump his $TRX 
things have been tough after the hack, I don't think polkadot will recover
big Scam sell nor before it's too late. they steal our money big red Flag
not to the Moon To the Crash
never LONG! only just SHORT!!
will go to 0 just like Luna! They already have problems with the Soled protocol that can،¦t provide liquidity!!! 
I was so happy that I eventually found this project!
is a dead network
great depression is coming in 
will drop with stocks again
next time don't let emotions get in the way of your investment
OND $BTC $ETH Bond perfect example of the current market pump and dump. prepare also for big dump $BTC and $ETH.
manipulation at work.. 80% of coins are centralised no   doubt. it's unfortunate 
Slow, sweet demise
bullish as hell
The big question is: When will miners sell all their ethereum!? It seems they don't have another alternative, they simply can discard thousands of hardware, they will have to take profit of this pump, then invest and mine other mineable GPU coins, that eventually will grow i.e.: another ethereum fork, ETC, BitTube, Ubiq, Grin, etc.... What do you people think?
with their coin-phone is scam!
DOT don't have limited supply, so for me is no good to invest in, because if they want, they can print more DOT and the value goes down.
will dissapear between 2023 and 2024
not fast enough.
zero value soon, see half year graph
bullish phase is coming along with bitcoin
dump is coming
pump and dump scheme
Predictable dip incoming.  It's boring watching the manipulation. 
This manipulation will eventually end. 
Better call Saul. AVAX is full of gangsters running a scheme. Do your research.
normally im looking at the 1hr and 1day chart, but i think for SOL im waiting for the 1wk to come down below 30. 25 dollars is my guess.
fake pump again and again and again 
*Inflation is not over
Dump it all. The leak is real. He did a Response and admitted all! 
ponzi scheme. why do I have to buy matic or LRC just to move my ETH around. such a bad programming. it's also the most hackable chain.
careful, big dump soon
Get wrecked Solana 
is just the way to go , their staking mechanism is just amazing
btc under 19k bombs away female dogs. hahaha. 
bull trap done. Big dump over the weekend.
fake pump it will go 20k soon
doge is just dying slowly. no utility like most other coins. no max supply, hopefully noone mints 6 trillion coins outta nowhere. sold out of this bad coin awhile ago. i need more utility than elon musk said its good.
fake pump copium
Just think how many whales lose if btc goes down. Then you耱l understand the manipulation. 
"I'll tell you a plan for gaining wealth. Just put aside you need for health. It's better than banking, trade or leases Take a bank note, fold it up & then you will find your money in creases!"
never catch falling knife
Doge must die! Stay away this.
down still to go 
$BTC and other coins will keep going down until the war ends. 
I bet you wished you sold ADA, and bought $LUNC  Another 偬coin. 鴂鴂
bearish af fake pump
is done, nothing more to say about this unreliable and unscalable chain
Waiting on FOMC results to come in 27-28th and Stock earnings to shed some light on where $BTC could dump/pump to. Bearish short term on $QNT, we could see it drop lower than previous lows of 40 and oscillate between that and 100 this bear market before any take off. DCA wisely. 
GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL HAVE THE SHIRT ON YOUR BACK ! 
Better invest in Avax
still bearish until the merge. We might see sell the news with the merge. 
Exactly right! Keep it up.
Signal bearish for $BTC  The Chinese government has capitalized on the violent downturn in the crypto market by warning crypto investors that Bitcoin prices are ،§heading to zero.،¨
caution  book profit and exit two major factor 1) US recession 2) China - Taiwan conflict now on a face of war, China will follow Russian statics on Ukrain. pls save your money and have patience and look fwd to 2023 Q1.
it's a centralized protocol defi on solend and turned off couple times and had to restart the "blockchain" also has lock up staking. 
95% is owned by developers. As soon as sec trial finishes they will sell
Complete waste of money and time.  Buy ETH.
we should see this fall back to the bottom slope.
Simply too centralised. Bearish. DYOR.
Will go back and correlate at 35 unless whales comes
Like I said... look at the 1M/3M chart. It is NOT an uptrend. World economy is not recovered, war has not stopped, record inflation has not been solved, recession has not been solved...
dead cat bounce it is.
